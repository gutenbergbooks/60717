  <h2 class='c004'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>From the first sting of a blackboard
pointer received at the hand of a primary
teacher for a slight overflow of energy, to
the last serious fracture of discipline
which I recall in High School, I pondered over
the methods used by my teachers and talked
with others, frequently, about this matter of
discipline.</p>

<p class='c008'>Very often after observing an extremely annoying
day for a teacher, who seemed to think
that all trouble was due to the pupils, I would
feel like rising in my seat, half through sympathy
and half through disgust, and shouting,
“Teacher, it’s all wrong. We pupils are human.
There are ways of appealing to us and getting
the results you want, if only you apply the right
methods.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The solving of various problems of discipline
for the purpose of helping teachers to accomplish
their tremendous task, has always appealed
to me very much, but it was not until my Senior
year in High School that I seriously considered
making the study of discipline my life-work.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the result of observing closely every
day for four years, the different methods used
by two High School instructors and, most important
of all, the consistent results of those
methods which convinced me that the subject of
discipline could be analyzed.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>The course, which you are starting to read, is
the result of long observation, careful study and
constant thought in this important field. The
subject has resolved itself into a very few fundamental
principles, the proper application of
which will invariably get results in the right
direction.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are no cut and dried rules with which
all school-room problems can be met; yet, the
wise experience of hundreds of teachers has
taught that there are certain principles which
can be safely followed and the application of
which will unfailingly increase the teacher’s success
in dealing with troublesome problems.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not only are the fundamental principles fully
explained and made simple, but there are definite
concrete school-room problems given, together
with the safest treatment to apply. The
problems are real. They have presented themselves
many times and will continue to present
themselves as long as schools exist.</p>

<p class='c008'>Correct methods are given to meet the most
perplexing situations as well as the petty though
annoying troubles that troop through each school
day. Each method presented has been tested
and tried and found to get good results.</p>

<p class='c008'>The application of the methods presented in
this course will also have a lasting effect on the
lives of those disciplined. This is an aim which,
indeed, must underlie all true discipline.</p>

<p class='c008'>The language and phraseology used is that
which can be understood by the most humble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>teacher. In speaking of the teacher always in
the masculine, I have followed the custom of
the specialists. “He” will mean usually “he or
she.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In preparing this course, I have constantly
kept in mind the thousands of teachers in every
quarter of the land—North, South, East and
West—who are laboring in one-room schools
where they are moulding the characters of boys
and girls who will be the men and women of
tomorrow; men, who will guide the destiny of
the state and women to be fit mothers of a greater
race. The teachers whose labors are in the rural
hamlets and the larger villages have been remembered;
also those whose tasks are more
manifold in the busy city where school-room
problems are varied and complex.</p>

<p class='c008'>This course is prepared to meet an almost universal
demand. Teachers, like all other practical
human beings, are eager for concrete information
and ideas which they can apply. Any
information at all which makes for better discipline
is, by the worthy teacher, considered
quite worth while.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Introductory Course</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Teaching school means infinitely more
than the mere giving of lessons in reading,
writing and arithmetic. It means the
moulding of human lives and characters.
The amount of good which a single enlightened
teacher may do for humanity can hardly be
over-estimated. Children of all grades look
upon their teachers in a certain sense as heroes
whom they admire and emulate. Great, therefore,
is the teacher’s responsibility.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Conduct and Discipline</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Not only is the teacher a great moral force in
the school and community but certain of his
traits and habits are so very closely related to
discipline that the first part of the book is devoted
exclusively to “The Teacher.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The teacher should have a very definite code
of morals—a code of morals that is in no sense
vague or indefinite or weak. He should not be
undecided even about small details relating to
the moral code. Children admire strong characters.
They are quick to detect weakness.</p>

<p class='c008'>This Course presents a code of morals for the
teacher which is very concrete. The teacher
will consider it most sensible because every idea
is grounded on sound and logical reasons. This
part of the Course, in presenting reasons along
with the detailed and definite code of morals
should help every teacher who reads it. Even
though you are now leading a strong, influential
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>life, reading this part of the Course will
strengthen your convictions and in that way help
you to be yet stronger.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>School Surroundings and Discipline</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It can not be denied that every factor in the
child’s surroundings has some influence upon
him. It would be difficult to introduce principles
of order and system into a child’s school
work, if that child were surrounded by disorder
in the school-room equipment. We all know
that the appetizing effect of a luncheon is
heightened by cleanliness, the taste with which
the luncheon and the dishes are arranged, even
the mode of serving the food and the general
appearance of the room. Comparatively few
teachers realize the relation of the school surroundings
to discipline. The second part of
the book is devoted to “The School.” This part
of the Course discusses various factors in the
surroundings which the teacher may control, and
suggests many things about the room equipment
which will greatly aid him in securing good
work and order.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every teacher, in dealing with pupils, should
have well fixed in his mind the true province
and end in discipline. The third division of
this book is devoted to “The Province and End
in Discipline,” which is an extremely important
discussion. No idea is less understood than is
discipline. In its restricted meaning and application,
it means far too little. Discipline permeates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>most thoroughly every activity of humankind.
Every avenue of progress owes its measure
of success to the measure of discipline found
therein. Could discipline come into its own
province and manifest its fullest force, there evidently
would be no need of penal institutions,
courts of justice and other reformatory measures.
Far too many teachers believe their work
in the school-room well done and designate
themselves as good disciplinarians if they have
managed to get through the school year without
any more serious difficulty than having to administer
a whipping or two, or perhaps, suspend a
pupil for a week or ten days. To call this discipline
is indeed deplorable.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>The True End in Discipline</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Some teachers on being asked, “What is the
end to be sought in discipline?” have answered,
“Good order.” Others have answered, “Quietness
such that lessons may be studied.” But these
are mere conditions of successful school work
and are not at all ends to be attained in discipline.
The teacher who thinks of these conditions
as being the ends in discipline is not only
liable to use improper means, but will be satisfied
with a mere semblance of success. The true
end of discipline is none other than the acquirement
of self-control. This includes six very definite
things which are explained in Part Three.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is the failure to understand the nature of
children, which causes so much friction and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>trouble with them. By “nature,” we do not mean
merely the child’s <i>disposition</i>, as this view is far
too narrow. Let us clearly explain, in the next
few paragraphs, the distinction between individual
disposition and fundamental nature.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>An Important Distinction</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It is true, popular lecturers often bore us by
speeches in which they emphasize over and over
the necessity of knowing the disposition of our
individual child. Of course, it is helpful to
know the individual disposition; but the mistaken
emphasis placed upon this detail as compared
with really knowing the general and
fundamental nature of children is indeed astounding.</p>

<p class='c008'>A case was reported to us not long ago of a
child-lecturer who chanced to be confronted
with a practical situation. Little “George,” his
son, was near a newspaper in the drawing-room.
The gentleman asked George to bring
the newspaper to him. George refused. The
command was repeated. “George, bring me the
newspaper.” George refused. He again gave
more commands, in a louder tone of voice while
George laughed at him. The lecturer then
started over to him and George ran behind a
table. The man soon managed to seize the boy’s
hand and escorted him over to the newspaper,
whereupon he again commanded him to pick up
the paper. George refused. The gentleman
took the boy’s hands and tried to force them to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>grasp the newspaper but George’s fingers were
lax. At this moment, George received a keen
slap on the side of the face. He was then told to
pick up the paper and he did so. Why? Merely
through fear? (The fallacy of this method will
be discussed later on.)</p>

<p class='c008'>The point of the above illustration is this:
That man would treat all of ten thousand other
children in precisely the same way as he did
George if they refused to obey him. And yet
this same lecturer is continually going before
mothers’ clubs and admonishing them thus:
“Mothers, mothers—know your individual
child.” If his doctrine is so important, why does
he not practice what he preaches? A man or
woman, parent or teacher, who can not get a
child to obey, without slapping him or threatening
him, has something fundamental to learn
about child training. This man not only failed
to be influenced by the boy’s <i>individual</i> disposition
but he showed by his method that he did not
understand the <i>fundamental</i> nature of children.</p>

<p class='c008'>To explain further the distinction between individual
disposition and fundamental nature,
you have in your room five pupils: Ralph,
Charley, Miriam, Fay and Helen. Let us
assume that these pupils are as different in disposition
as it is possible for them to be. Ralph
is pessimistic, secretive and has a bad temper.
Charley is optimistic, frank and very amiable.
Miriam and Fay have certain other opposite
characteristics and Helen is in a class by herself—overbearing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>spiteful, high tempered and hard
to approach.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now what shall we do? Must we use a fundamentally
different method on each of these
pupils in order to reach the same result? By no
means. While these five pupils have characteristics
which are distinctly their own and different
from each other, yet they have precisely
the <i>same instincts underlying their actions</i>. They
have the same <i>individual</i> instincts, the same
<i>adaptive</i> instincts, the same <i>social</i> instincts, the
same <i>regulative</i> instincts and the same <i>parental</i>
instincts. If we appeal to the same instinct in
one child that we appeal to in another we will
get a similar result. The expression will not be
exactly the same, of course. One child may react
more quickly than another or with more
enthusiasm but nevertheless the response will be
similar. For example, if I do something which
Ralph sees is going to push forward his own interests:
if I praise Ralph for something which
he has done, he will react in the same direction
as will Charley, Miriam, Fay and Helen when
I appeal to the same instinct in them, such as
their instinctive desire for approval.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of only five pupils, we might take a
hundred or a thousand pupils, each one having
a disposition slightly different from all the
others. Their natures are all based upon certain
fundamental instincts common to the race.
Therefore, it is this fundamental nature of the
pupil which we must know. The disposition of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>the particular pupils is a matter of detail as compared
with the deep-seated and essential nature
and will not trouble us much after we have
learned the fundamental principles of child
supervision, because <i>all</i> children have the same
natural instincts and, in applying principles, we
appeal to these instincts. Part Four of this book
is devoted exclusively to the naming and explaining
of these great fundamental principles.</p>

<p class='c008'>A teacher who thoroughly understands each
of these principles is in possession of information
that is really invaluable in discipline. It would
be well for each teacher to read over these important
principles several times during the
school year. The reading can not fail to aid in
getting better discipline.</p>

<p class='c008'>The best possible way to acquire skill in discipline
is to study a great variety of typical examples.
In fact, the author has planned other
volumes devoted exclusively to concrete cases of
discipline.</p>

<p class='c008'>By a concrete case is meant an interruption or
annoyance caused by one or more pupils at a
given time, which must be dealt with by the
teacher in one way or another.</p>

<p class='c008'>Very often a teacher, after observing the results
of a certain method, will look back and
say, “If I had that to do over again, I would
treat the case differently.” Perhaps he has asked
a child a question which, on account of the embarrassing
circumstances, caused him to tell a
falsehood; perhaps he has tried to force obedience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>instead of attaining the end in a better way.
These and dozens of other cases might be suggested
which often confront a teacher and unless
he has correct ideas about disposing of them
when they arise, he will have no small amount of
trouble before the year is over. That teacher is
almost sure to fail who waits for the occasion to
select a method instead of preparing beforehand
for different emergencies.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Treatment of Cases According to Age</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The proper decision in cases of discipline is so
extremely important that the cases which may
arise in <i>each grade</i> should be treated separately.
For example, all the problems which may present
themselves to the first grade teacher may be
recorded under the head “First Grade” and the
remedy given for each case. The same is true of
the second grade and so on through the High
School. Special and very definite instructions
should be framed for the proper discipline of
pupils of various ages in the same room of the
country school.</p>

<p class='c008'>The methods must be safe methods. Some
times an unenlightened teacher will use a
method which not only fails to get good results
but which actually aggravates the trouble. The
very nature of the methods given in this Course
is such that a teacher may be sure the best possible
plan is being employed, viewed from the
standpoint of positive good results that will
surely follow.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>The teacher will find it a great source of pleasure
to have the subject of discipline so well in
mind and so thoroughly analyzed and thought
out that when a case arises, he can not only apply
a method which he thinks is right but one which
he knows is right.</p>

<p class='c008'>Oftentimes, a teacher is confronted with such
a difficult situation that no matter what method
is applied, good results will not be seen immediately.
In such cases it is extremely assuring
for a teacher to <i>know</i> that the particular method
which he has applied is the best possible method
that could be used in that situation.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the treatment of all cases, not only are the
correct methods outlined in detail, but fundamental
reasons should be given showing <i>why</i> the
method suggested is the best in each case. In
the treatment of all cases, applications are to be
made of the fundamental principles.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are not a few teachers, as well as
parents, who continue to use physical force in
attempting to govern. It is indeed appalling
how blind some people are on matters of discipline.</p>

<p class='c008'>They will get poor results repeatedly from applying
a given method and yet they fail to see
that their child’s bad behavior is due to their
own faulty method. Why do not parents think
about changing their own method which <i>causes</i>
the child to misbehave instead of forever blaming
the child? This is a question that is not easy
to answer. Business men, after finding that a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>certain form of advertising does not pay, discontinue
that form of advertising and yet they are
not half so reasonable in their own homes.</p>

<p class='c008'>For instance, it is a common occurrence for a
parent to flog a child for telling a falsehood.
The child continues to tell falsehoods one day
after another and the parent continues to use the
punishing method. Seldom, if ever, does the
parent think of changing his method.</p>

<p class='c008'>Often, when interviewing parents about a
child, they will offer some reason for punishing
which to them seems perfectly sound but they
ignore the fact that fear of punishment is one of
the chief causes of falsifying and that to punish
for a known falsehood today makes the child
more secretive tomorrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many persons likewise, base obedience upon
fear of punishment. Their children know that
when they hear a command, they must obey at
once or receive a whipping. Here is a logical
proposition: If obedience is based upon fear instead
of confidence; that is, if the child obeys
only through fear, then when fear is gradually
removed (at fourteen or fifteen when the child
begins to feel the assurance of manhood) obedience
naturally becomes weaker. Many parents
wonder what is wrong when they lose control
of their adolescent boys and girls; yet the reason
is perfectly obvious. If obedience is based upon
confidence, as it should be, the changes which
accompany adolescence will not remove the only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>basis of obedience, as in the case of fear, but will
make the parents’ grasp even more secure.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many parents are thoughtful enough to have
at least their own reason for using a certain
method, while others, unfortunately, hardly
think at all. They have one method which they
attempt to use as a cure for all bad traits as well
as for particular misdemeanors. A situation
presents itself and because of some pre-conceived
notion, the same old remedy is suggested and
administered.</p>

<p class='c008'>What is true of a great many parents in this
regard is also true of a great many teachers. If
parents and teachers were to try some practical
tests in discipline, keep a record on paper of the
treatment of certain offenses followed immediately
by the obvious results of those methods,
and then draw reasonable conclusions at the end
of a week or a month, they would have something
valuable to work upon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Most educators advise the use of corporal punishment
as a <i>last</i> resort, yet far too many teachers
in carrying out this advice really use it not only
as a last resort but as a first, last and only resort.
Here is the situation—in fact, a very common
situation for a teacher who does not have the
confidence of his pupils. A boy is told to do or
not to do a certain thing. He openly disobeys.
The teacher feels that he must make an example
of him and humiliate him at once before the
school.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let us conclude, then, that the day of corporal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>punishment as an important agency in
school discipline has passed never to return. And
let us also conclude that its passing is not yet
complete and can not be complete until social
customs and prejudices have been thoroughly
adjusted to the new order and until effective
methods of dealing with acute disciplinary difficulties
have been discovered, standardized and
made effective by general recognition.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>In this brief Introductory Course, one can not
go much into detail on any one point. In regard
to punishment, however, this hint is in place. If
anyone is interested enough to really find out for
himself and settle in his own mind once for all,
questions concerning correct discipline, let him
personally interview a large number of boys. Let
him get some of their views. Let him talk over
the matter frankly with some other teacher’s pupils.
He will thereby not only enlighten himself
as to the best policy about punishing boys but the
experience of talking in a confidential way with
big-hearted boys (and they will all seem big-hearted
if only he assumes that they are) will
give him a new inspiration and a more optimistic
view about his future discipline in the school-room.
He will feel more capable of appealing
to the child’s mind and heart and will see less
necessity than ever before for having to force
even the most stubborn child to do his bidding.</p>

<p class='c008'>The author’s own view on punishment is this:
the more a teacher knows about child nature and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>correct fundamental principles, the less he will
need to use corporal punishment. The aim of
this Course is to present the teacher with such
concrete information, based upon a correct
knowledge of child nature, that its application
by the teacher will enable him to succeed in discipline
without any corporal punishment whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course, there will always be exceptions. A
certain pupil may be apparently abnormal and
extremely hard to govern. But even with the
proverbial exception, really surprising things
can be accomplished by the application of wise
methods.</p>

<p class='c008'>The aim, stated above, is not unreasonable.
The author has clear evidence of this. In his
own town, the superintendent of schools went so
far as to allow even the <i>pupils</i> to know that he
would not punish them with physical pain. He
explained why he would not and the result was
wonderful, as he expected. Instead of the pupils
taking advantage of such a policy, it <i>appealed</i> to
them. They respected this superintendent.
They realized that he was there to help them
and they allowed him to do so.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>A Real Accomplishment</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Out of seventy pupils who attended the school
at the opening of the term, sixty-seven were in
regular attendance throughout the year and two
of the three pupils who did drop out had
very good outside reasons. This record is astonishing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>but the discipline in that High School
is also remarkable. This superintendent has
carried out with wonderful results the principles
explained in this Course.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>The Common Sense Factor</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Some people tell us that teachers are born and
not made, that tact is an innate quality. Of
course, there is a certain amount of truth in this.
It is needless to say that not all teachers can
attain the same high degree of efficiency in controlling
a school. But to say that a certain
teacher can never succeed, because he does not
have tact, is to express ignorance of the true
nature of tact. Tact can not be entirely separated
from knowledge. Tact and common sense increase
in direct proportion to the advance of
one’s knowledge.</p>

<p class='c008'>One employs tact when he says and does the
right thing at the right time and place. Tact implies
skill in dealing with immediate circumstances.
Therefore, the more experience one has
in dealing with a given circumstance the more
proficient he should become. The mind profits
by experience. A wise teacher also profits by
ideas. If someone relates a case of discipline to
you in which tact was used, you can use the same
idea in a similar circumstance and you will also
be using tact.</p>

<p class='c008'>For example, a certain teacher on entering a
new school in the fall, learns that five or six of
the larger boys have been talking on the street
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>about whipping him out, in case he gets “cute.”
If this teacher allows his pupils to find out in any
way whatever that his mind is bothered about it;
if he gets up before the school and attempts to
make a speech calling attention to the gossip, he
will thereby show very little tact and the offending
pupils will most surely cause him more
trouble.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the other hand, suppose that, sometime
when he is with the boys, without any evidence
of anxiety, he incidentally remarks, “I see no
need of trying to correct pupils by whipping
them. People have nearly always treated me
justly because I have dealt fairly with them.”
This is using tact. The boys will not annoy this
man; they will respect him.</p>

<p class='c008'>So with hundreds of cases. Having each instance
worked out in detail, the teacher may determine
the minute application of good methods.
In this way he can avoid harmful schemes and
employ only tactful plans.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is the ignorant teacher who is untactful; it is
the wise and well-educated teacher who is tactful.
By well-educated, here, is meant educated in
proper discipline. A teacher may be a good
scholar and yet be poorly trained in controlling
a school.</p>

<p class='c008'>The teacher who is well trained in matters of
discipline does not look upon the many so-called
puzzling circumstances as problems at all, because
they so readily fit into his system of knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>that he knows at once how to prevent prospective
difficulties.</p>

<p class='c008'>There will never be a day in which you will
not use the ideas in this Course, consciously or
unconsciously, in one way or another. The ideas
presented are fundamental.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is only one more thought the author
wishes to leave with you in this Introductory
Course before taking up the instructions in the
regular Course. That is this: a child is influenced
more by those teachers whom he likes
and admires than by those whom he dislikes and
who antagonize him. Therefore, it is hoped
that each teacher will begin the reading of this
Course with a strong conviction and a firm determination
to gain from it a means of getting
the child’s confidence, which will enable him
to be a power for good in guiding young lives
aright.</p>

<p class='c008'>No teacher has attained the greatest joy in his
profession until he has received from boys and
girls letters of overflowing thanks for past helpfulness.
And every teacher will realize this joy
who conducts his school in a rational way and
who learns methods by means of which he can
place discipline upon the natural basis of confidence.</p>

<p class='c008'>When you have learned the relation of your
own <i>conduct</i> to discipline and the relation of
your <i>school</i> to discipline; when you have come to
realize the real <i>province</i> and true <i>end</i> of discipline;
when you have completely learned the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>great fundamental and universal <i>principles</i> of
discipline which work toward this ideal end and
finally when you have learned to apply these
principles to the dozens of concrete, typical <i>cases</i>
with which you will always be confronted in
the school-room, then you will be in possession
of knowledge that will not only cause you to be
sought for by school authorities, to teach in
better schools at far better remuneration, but it
will enable you to do infinitely more for boys and
girls, thus making life itself better for yourself
and others.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>PART ONE<br /> <br /><span class='sc'>The Teacher</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Someone has truthfully said, “Without
a teacher there can be no school.” It is a
university when a great teacher, like
Mark Hopkins, sits on a log with the lad,
James A. Garfield, and pours forth his store of
knowledge for the eager mind of the backwoods
boy. All other elements of a school may be
absent, except the teacher, who as a living fountain
of knowledge interests the mind of the lad
because he possesses those qualifications that are
found in the true teacher. The vital factor of
the school—be it the humblest one room school;
the best one room school; a village school or the
many roomed high school in the metropolis of
the land—the vital and all-important factor is
the teacher. The teacher is the inspiring force
in the school-room, bringing light and hope and
accomplishing more by influence over the children
than by any other means.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>The Teacher as a Leader</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The teacher must be a leader—a true leader—a
leader in social ethics, in private morals, in
character-building, in religion, in fact in all that
goes to make life worth while. This seems almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>too much to demand of the teacher but it
should be expected nevertheless, for it is not exaggeration
to say that the teacher’s work is the
greatest of all tasks. His clay is God’s chosen
material. Every great work needs a controlling
brain and a true heart and it is to be expected
that God’s greatest work needs them in a superlative
degree. If they are absent, the school is
like a dead body without the vital spark. If the
school is without the true and faithful teacher—even
though all else be present, the best and
most lasting results are impossible. The cry of
the hearts of the children is that they be instructed
and nourished and, finally, sent into the
world fired with a zeal and purpose that will
prompt them to the most heroic efforts in the
world’s work.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is the dream of every child to worship some
hero, to be held spell-bound by some great life—a
life that possesses some traits that appeal to
him. The teacher must be the hero; the teacher
must embody these traits. The child upon finding
such a teacher will do his bidding gladly,
will start on any mission at his request, and will
be proud to serve the dictates of a master-will—a
will influenced by the Divine will. How many
men and women will admit that all the good that
is in them and the usefulness they manifest, they
owe to the example and teaching, or to the memory
of some sainted teacher—a teacher who consecrated
himself to God, thereby finding his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>place and wielding his influence over child life
for good.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though the teacher’s task seems to be the most
difficult, after all its importance makes it the
greatest and best, and what better or higher work
is there than to help children and young men and
women to a clearer vision of truth, to a nobler
sense of duty, to encourage and inspire to higher
ideals and motives of life, that are bounded only
by eternity? It is the teacher, who at his best,
stands between the child and the various experiences
that await him. The teacher, from his
larger store of knowledge, directs the child towards,
and introduces him to, those forms of experience
which are especially adapted to bring
out and develop the element of perfect control.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two teachers may use the same mechanism of
methods—the one may fail and the other succeed.
They may be using the same system of marking
and grading, rewarding, and reporting to
parents, still the one fails while the other succeeds.
Their environments, too, may be the
same. The failure of the one is to be sought in
the teacher, so too, is the success of the other.
The vital need is the proper qualification of the
teacher.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The responsibility of the schoolmaster does
not end when the boy leaves school any more
than the responsibility of the ship-builder ends
on the day of the launch. Each is commissioned
to construct a seaworthy vessel, competent to sail
either in calm or in stormy seas, and each neglects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>his duty if he is content merely to build up a
fairly handsome structure which will glide
gracefully off the ways and keep afloat until the
crowd has dispersed.”<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Purpose of Teaching</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps, no more important question should
the teacher ask himself than this, “Why am I
teaching?” Is it because a brother or sister or
parent or friend has taught or is teaching, or because
he must earn a livelihood to support himself
or family, or because he thinks he loves
children, or enjoys instructing, or glories in
power, or believes he has ability as a disciplinarian,
or considers the work of teaching easy, dignified
and above reproach, or the day short,
giving time for other pursuits; or is it because he
considers teaching a stepping stone to some other
life profession, or, as is the case with too many
women, employment to tide over the period between
graduation from the high school and
matrimony; or that he feels he is capable of no
other work and is teaching because he believes
himself small and fitted for doing a small work;
or, does he believe that there is in teaching an
opportunity to accomplish great good and to be
of valuable service to mankind? There may
be some other motive or motives that induce the
teacher to undertake his work, but his should
be the most worthy purpose. No teacher can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>expect to do his fullest measure of service and
gain that contentment and happiness, that come
to the good teacher, if his motive or motives for
teaching are not the noblest and best. If any
teacher takes up the profession of teaching—the
art of arts—his must be a true aim to be of service
to mankind. No teacher can successfully
control those under his care and teaching, unless
he believes that his work is the most vital. His
heart and interest must be in his work; otherwise,
it is his duty to leave the teaching profession.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Preparation</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>A requisite of the teacher that can not be overlooked
is the ability to teach. It is an unmistakable
preface to teaching to have the proper desire
to teach. It is to be hoped that the day is not far
distant, when all teachers must have a normal
training of not less than one year, and that every
Normal School be required to cultivate the
natural qualities most essential to teachers. Every
student entering a Normal School should satisfy
his instructors that he possesses superior ability
in his chosen profession. The Normal School
should be required to recommend, without exception,
to other fields of activity, all those who
after a sufficient time in the school do not promise
to qualify as teachers of ability. One does himself
great injustice to enter a profession for
which he is not by nature and by training qualified;
and a far greater injury is done those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>come under his instruction if he is not a natural
and trained teacher.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Scholarship</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Without a doubt, a most important requisite
of the teacher is good scholarship—a thorough
knowledge of the subjects to be taught. His
knowledge must be not only thorough, but fresh.
He, too, must be a broader student of the subjects
he teaches than one who merely knows the text
he is using. It is evident that a teacher can not
teach more than he knows, and often the keen
mind of a pupil leaves the realm of the text-book
and legitimately inquires into the depths of
knowledge. He may embarrass the unprepared
teacher, or the teacher whose knowledge of the
subject is no broader than the text. The teacher’s
preparation must not be superficial, it must be
like a fountain—ever fresh and flowing, connecting
that which has been passed over and that
which is to come. This is an essential element of
successful instruction, but many can not see why
it should influence discipline.</p>

<p class='c008'>The teacher who is a deep and inexhaustible
fountain of knowledge wins the confidence of his
pupils, and whatever increases confidence decreases
the necessity of imposed discipline and
control, and it is true that whatever decreases
the confidence of the pupils in the teacher increases
the necessity for outer control. Confidence
in the ability and preparation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>teacher is the basis of ready obedience. It is the
element that begets a prompt and cheerful yielding
of the pupil’s will to the will of the teacher.</p>

<p class='c008'>The teacher should never cease to be a student.
Though he thinks himself thoroughly educated,
he should always go over the material which he
intends to teach; to this, he should add a wide
range of reading outside of the lesson proper, but
bearing upon the lesson. In this way he will be
able to give to his pupils more than is found in
the lesson. The teacher who unceasingly pursues
such tactics in the preparation of his work
will arouse interest in his classes and interest will
secure attention which in turn will produce diligence
in study. It is a self-evident principle,
that interest on the part of the teacher will produce
interest on the part of the pupil and interest
will promote application and progress. Many a
teacher who has been otherwise weak in the
ability to discipline properly, has easily controlled
large classes by the interest he has manifested
in his work, because he was accurate and
full in his instruction.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>As a Student of Nature</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Aside from the teacher’s thorough preparation
and knowledge of the subjects he teaches, he
must be well versed in other matters. No teacher
can fulfill the measure of his calling, unless he is
a lover and student of Nature. This may be difficult
for the teacher within the confines of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>large city. However, no city is so large, that all
phenomena of Nature are shut out and whatever
means are at hand, should be used and thoroughly
understood. Some tiny park, or well kept
front yard, even a stray bird, a sparrow, the rain,
the clouds, and the snow flakes are Nature’s
property, and where is the teacher who should
be unlearned in any of these subjects? For the
teacher whose happy lot it is to teach in the rural
districts or villages, it would be a shame indeed,
if he did not know the every pulse beat of
Nature. Could there really be a teacher who
could not control a large band of boys and girls,
if he were always ready to expound the secrets of
the forest, of the seasons, of the air, and put life
and breath into all the vast out-of-doors and her
varied phenomena?</p>

<p class='c008'>It is almost a necessity that every teacher
should have studied psychology in his preparation
for teaching; still the author has been in
states where there are no laws concerning this requirement
for teachers; there are scores of
teachers who have not even read one text in
psychology.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many have been the definitions given of psychology,
but in the end they do not differ seriously.
Since psychology is the interpretation
of human nature, the admission must be made
that every teacher should have a clear knowledge
of the subject. Psychology will not produce a
teacher, it is true, but teachers are compelled to
study and to know human nature and the laws
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>governing it, so that common sense methods may
be developed. The study of psychology is usually
involved in all discussion of methods. The teaching
process involves the mind of the child and it
is reasonable to demand that the teacher should
know the main outlines of modern psychology.</p>

<p class='c008'>Without further argument, it is apparent that
a clear and comprehensive knowledge of psychology
is necessary for the teacher. Not alone
should the teacher have an understanding knowledge
of psychology, but he should read some
good texts on psychology and its allied branches
every year.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Child Study</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>No teacher, then, should consider himself educated
or prepared to teach who has not given
himself some preparation through child study,
this greatest of all school subjects, which is
simply genetic psychology practically applied.
This subject is new, and at best, the teacher who
has carefully studied it will know too little. Still
there is no excuse for the teacher who does not
know something about the following phases of
the psychology of children: the child’s soul or
mind, acting as memory, imagination and reason;
the chief facts concerning the child’s affections,
ambitions, motives and ideals; adolescence—physical,
mental and moral phases; relations to
other children and elders; his sense of humor and
responsibility; his moral obligations; his views
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>concerning himself, society, and the local community;
his views of Nature; the principles of
child growth; the normal height and weight of
children; the common defects of children as
weak eyes, defective hearing, adenoids, spinal
curvature and other ailments that attack childhood;
the child’s likes and dislikes and all the
activities that most interest him.</p>

<p class='c008'>No sensible teacher will undertake to teach the
child a new subject until he understands just
what the child can do. Then it is an evident conclusion
that the process of teaching can be elevated
above the plane of a haphazard undertaking
to that of a systematic science by the teacher who
has studied the child in his manifold complexities.
It follows then that a teacher’s preparation
at its best is not complete until he has a workable
knowledge of child psychology.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Reading</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The teacher’s preparation is not complete
without the reading of good books. Every true
teacher is a student, and to make it possible to
remain a student he can not neglect reading good
books. Reading the best books in every field of
the teacher’s work, and even in many other fields
for the purpose of gaining new knowledge is a
requirement of the teacher that should not be
overlooked. In reading for pleasure and recreation,
care must be exercised in choosing reading
material. Only the best should be selected by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>the teacher and that which will give the most aid
to his work.</p>

<p class='c008'>The teacher must be a careful reader; he
should not hasten through a book, just to be reading.
Important passages should be marked.
Whatever is of use to the teacher should be correlated
to his work to add more to the subject
taught. The author in all his reading, even in
fiction, has made use of this method—marking
all important passages and quotations as he read;
then, in the back of the book, he constructed a
list of pages where each passage or quotation was
to be found. Following the number of the page
in his index, he put a brief note, or sometimes
only a word to explain the nature of the passage.
To illustrate: quotations or passages of general
interest were marked (general); a passage bearing
upon history, marked (history), etc. When
he sought some thought or passage upon a certain
subject, it was easy to look to the “homemade”
index of the books read and hastily locate such
information.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Reading for a Purpose</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>To the teacher books are companions. He
should go to them in time of need. They will
give assistance. For recreation they will afford
rest, and for information they will prove a never-ending
source. Every book the teacher reads,
should be read for a purpose. It is a good plan
to discuss a book read with a friend or one who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>has read it and is interested in the line of thought
treated. Fiction usually portrays some strong
character types, as well as weak character types;
these make excellent themes for talks on moods
and kindred issues. The wise teacher is always
ready to cite some good character study or tell
some interesting tale or anecdote bearing upon
the subject being studied and taught. When interest
lags on a dreary day, or when the entire
school seems to have the “blues”—and every
teacher knows that there are such times—he can
save the situation and avoid embarrassment by
narrating some interesting story. Fiction abounds
in character portrayals, anecdotes and stories.
These can be marked and indexed as to kind as
explained above.</p>

<p class='c008'>The question as to what kind of books a teacher
should read may arise. There can be no harm in
reading every type of book—books that bear
upon every phase of life. However meager a
teacher’s income may be or uncertain the place
of his abode, he should have a library. The word
library does not mean that he must have a hundred
or more books. How many great men have
had only a Bible, Pilgrim’s Progress, and perhaps
a book or two of poems, and yet owned a
library far more valuable than is often possessed
by the indiscriminate booklover! A few books
well read are better than many unread.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be well to add this precaution. There
are scores of good books bearing upon method,
pedagogy and various phases of the teacher’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>work. Books written for the teacher are intended
to inform, and not to give exact directions
for every activity of the teacher. There can be
no such book as the latter. It is true, every
school bears the same aspects, and fundamental
principles underlie the teaching process, but
“cut and dried” rules and formulæ can work only
for artificial ends. A good book seeks to suggest,
and the wise teacher improves every suggestion.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Papers and Magazines</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>In addition to the reading of good books the
teacher should read several good papers and
magazines. Here the greatest caution is necessary.
This is an age of every kind of journalism,
much of it really dangerous, and frequently the
most appealing paper or magazine may prove to
be the most harmful. It is a safe rule to read
those papers and magazines that have been
proven worthy by time and use. One good daily
is sufficient; in its pages the teacher can scan the
activities of the world. This need not take much
time. A few minutes each day will be ample.
A teacher should avoid sensational murder
“writeups,” robberies and articles designed to
create curiosity rather than to give facts and information.
However, the tried and conservative
daily avoids glaring headlines, announcing atrocities
of every kind.</p>

<p class='c008'>What the teacher should know, is what the
world is doing in commerce, industry, science,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>invention, legislation, discovery, religion, arts,
manufacturing and those great events which
shape history. The teacher who reads papers and
magazines for the above purpose will be abreast
of the times. He should read one good teacher’s
paper. There should be no trouble experienced
in finding one as there are numerous excellent
magazines published. Yet, care must be exercised,
for many teacher’s papers and magazines
are nothing less than trash. The editors, like so
many business men, hope to reap a harvest of
money instead of following the motive of service
to their fellow men. A good magazine can not
be omitted from the teacher’s reading. While it
is true, that much which appears is written only
for the remuneration; that is, each issue must be
filled and almost anything will do, and many of
the stories appeal only to a class of people who
will read only the very poorest of literature;
still, the teacher need not despair in his choice.
He must read that journal the reputation of
which has been established and the pages of
which are edited by live men and women who
are discussing live issues.</p>

<p class='c008'>In concluding the discussion on the teacher’s
preparation, it is obvious from what has been
said, that the teacher must always remain a
student. He must read to learn; he must investigate
to know; he must delve into Nature to
learn, and it is not at all absurd for him to study
again those books which he faithfully studied
during his Normal School training.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>The Teacher’s Morals</h3>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It seems almost unnecessary to say that a
teacher should be moral. It is an important requisite.
Although the teacher’s choice of his
profession, his ability to teach and his preparation
have been discussed first, the reader may
consider the teacher’s morality the first requisite.
The author can not conceive of a <i>successful</i>
teacher, who would possess every essential
quality except the quality of being moral. It
is a foregone conclusion that a teacher is supposed
to be a moral person. While this is true,
sad to say there yet remain many teachers whose
notions of a moral code are crude. They violate
some of the smallest details of the moral code
and thereby undermine their success, to say
nothing about lessening the service they are
attempting to render to mankind. It is not too
radical to say that a teacher, above all other
professional people <i>must</i> be moral. His idea
of a moral code must not be vague; it must not
contain conflicting ideas. He, above all, must
have definite notions concerning morals. It is
true that the term is too generally misused.
Many teachers attempt to teach morals in such
a way that the pupils have altogether a wrong
idea of ethics and consequently, in their daily
lives are doing many things that are immoral,
still believing that they are shunning that which
is not right.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is the purpose of the following discussion to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>set the teacher right on what the term “moral” in
its strictest sense includes; and what constitutes a
breach of morality will be clearly set forth. For
many years educators have been examining the
moral requisites in a teacher, and there can be no
doubt as to the correctness of these ideas. No
attempt will be made to generalize, but specific
and concrete ideas will be presented. In other
words, what is immoral will be discussed in such
plain terms that the teacher can easily frame for
himself a workable moral code.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Meaning of Moral</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>At the outset, it will be well to explain the
term, moral. Specifically, to be moral is to act in
accordance with the laws of right. At once, the
conflicting question arises: May not what one
considers right another consider wrong? But,
this is not a difficult question. It is not what one
person or another may <i>think</i> about it; it is what
the <i>results</i> will be. The past points unmistakably
to the results of all that has been done. In
the dictionary of the past can be found the record
of the results of every action. Have the results
been beneficial and serviceable to mankind, then
the action was moral; if the opposite, then the
action was immoral. Without further explanation,
those actions that injure the individual or
society will be regarded as immoral.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is granted that a teacher should not become
intoxicated, or fight, gamble, visit places of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>doubtful character, associate with persons whose
characters are questionable, violate the law in
any way, break the Sabbath, swear, or blaspheme,
cheat, lie or be guilty of lewd conduct. These
are immoral acts. There is no question as to their
nature. They <i>are</i> wrong. Still the author has
met teachers who committed some of the above
wrongs. At a certain board meeting a young
man was asked to present his resignation, because
he was proven guilty of a grossly immoral act.
It is hard to understand why any teacher should
even be guilty of minor wrongs, much less, any
of the larger offenses against the moral code. It
is to be hoped that this book will seldom fall
into the hands of any teacher who is so base as
to be guilty of a wilful wrong.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is true that many questionable actions in
which men and women indulge themselves, are
by them, not always considered wrong. While
this may be the case, it becomes necessary to inquire
what influence such actions may have or
what the results may be. If evil alone can be
traced back to such actions, or results that are
damaging, then such actions must be conceded to
be wrong, and therefore immoral by anyone,
however ardent an advocate of the questioned
actions he may be.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, the application of the above principle to
some concrete actions, that are much disputed as
to whether they are wrong or not, must tend to
satisfy the most doubting mind. <i>If injury can be
shown as the result of any action, that action must</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span><i>then be wrong.</i> All must agree to this. Then,
the discussion must lead to the results of these
disputed actions. The first of these under consideration
will be smoking. Every teacher can
recall an instance where some boy worshipped a
certain man because he found in him all those
attributes that make a true man, except that the
man smoked. But the boy held him as a hero,
and because the man smoked, he believed there
could be no harm in it. The influence of the man
induced the boy to smoke. The moulding of a
human life is the most important work in the
world, and if this book can say something that
will cause a teacher to feel a keener responsibility
in his work and life than ever before, in the fulfilling
of his most important position, then it will
not have been written in vain.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Consider Weakness of Others</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The teacher may argue that no harm came to
him from smoking because he smoked moderately,
and no harm can come to the boy if he will
be moderate. But, the teacher cannot insure <i>this</i>
influence of his action. Every sensible teacher
must admit that there are not a few instances
where positive harm has come to smokers. At
this point it is well to say that the pipe, the cigar,
chewing tobacco, and the exceptional snuffing
of tobacco, are all related closely to the cigarette,
which gets most of the blame for the harm done
by tobacco. They are all evil and their use is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>immoral. That no teacher may be in doubt as
to whether smoking a cigarette, a cigar or a pipe,
or chewing and snuffing tobacco have evil results,
it may be advisable to call attention to actual
records of many concrete cases; and cases in
which much harm has been suffered are not
isolated, but are generally distributed. The
records of any city superintendent of schools will
reveal scores of cases of boys whose minds have
been weakened, whose muscular organisms are
shattered, whose nervous systems are irresponsive
and beyond the boy’s control, in fact, whose
entire lives are wrecks, because they indulged in
the use of tobacco. Every user of tobacco, at
first, is a moderate user, but the evil habit leads
to demoralization and excessiveness. Any juvenile
judge can cite many instances of boys who
were brought into the juvenile court, because
their minds were depraved and their passions all
out of restraint, because the use of tobacco had
had its evil effect upon the boys’ minds. If the
reader will concede that some evil comes from
the use of tobacco, then the argument is complete;
for any action that necessarily has evil
results is wrong, therefore, immoral and the
teacher has no right to perform that act.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Gossiping</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>No one questions the fact that gossiping and its
attendant indulgences, loafing, are evils. Nevertheless,
teachers are too prone to indulge themselves,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>thereby profoundly influencing their
school associates in no good way. It should be
above every teacher to gossip about anyone.
When the time comes to report an insubordinate
or bad pupil to the superintendent or to the
board of education, the facts should be told and
no more. The teacher—man or woman—has no
right to report the evil of one pupil to another
pupil or to patrons or parents, even to members
of his or her immediate family. A safe rule to
follow, is this: “If one can say nothing good
about anyone, say nothing at all.” This brings
up the question, can a teacher, with propriety,
gossip about other teachers, neighbors, patrons
and parents? No. It is degrading. Avoid it.
The city club, the social gathering, the proverbial
“husking bee,” the quilting, or “gathering”
of any kind is too often the hotbed where gossip
thrives. A teacher cannot afford to share in it.
Better than take part, keep silent. It is bad
enough to listen.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Association with Loafers</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Many a man teacher has thought in order to
be a good mixer, he must be friendly, or social
and linger with the drug store crowd, or stop at
the street corner—where usually the loafers congregate—to
take part in the conversation. Not
always, but generally the topic of conversation is
idle gossip, or worse than that, “smutty” stories
are being told. To listen is immoral; to indulge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>is worse. But, should the teacher pass by without
even so much as noticing the crowd? By no
means. He should cultivate the good will of all,
even of the street corner gangs. Then what must
he do? He can give a friendly greeting and
make a pleasant remark, turning the tide of conversation
toward right channels.</p>

<p class='c008'>The story is told of Ulysses S. Grant, that when
he was a boy, he came one evening into one of
the grocery stores of his home town, Galesburg,
Ill., and soon after entering, heard one of the
loafers say, he would tell a certain story if there
were no women in the store. The idler craned
his neck and asked if there were any women near.
At this point, the youthful Grant said, “No, but
there is a gentleman present.” The story was not
told. The writer recalls a superintendent of
schools, who attended a Men’s Church Banquet
and told such offensive stories that even men,
who before thought little about telling an objectionable
story, were disgusted. The influence of
this superintendent was so extensive that he led
many others to tell evil stories. The boys of the
entire school, as a consequence, were addicted to
this vicious habit. Many of them admitted to
the writer the evil habit, and pointed to the
superintendent as the one who had influenced
them to do what they considered evil and immoral.</p>

<p class='c008'>Further admission from the boys revealed that
many of the girls told shockingly offensive stories
and that some of the boys followed the evil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>stories by the evil actions suggested. <i>All</i> because
one man did not have the moral stamina required
of a decent teacher and superintendent. To conclude,
no teacher—man or woman—can afford to
gossip, to talk about anything, except that which
the most refined and exacting mind may hear
without criticism.</p>

<p class='c008'>There can be no question as to the impropriety
of idle gossip and bad stories, but there may be
included the so-called “yarn,” and attempts at
humor designed to create laughter at the expense
of a friend on account of unavoidable defects, affected
speech, “smart” expressions, and the like.
To the average child the above deviations from
the correct usage of language are repulsive.
There are teachers who have the happy characteristics
of being humorous and can employ that
trait to good advantage but it should not be attempted,
if it causes an auditor pain. The teacher
should use only good English; that is, pure English
which will serve the teacher who is inclined
to indulge in trivialities of speech.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Slang Expressions</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It is needless to say that a teacher should not
swear or use blasphemy. But how disgusting it
is to enter a school-room where the mistakes of
the pupils are corrected by “gracious,” “my
land,” “gee,” and scores of other useless words
that are classed as slang. It is not unreasonable
to say that such words are nearly as bad in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>school-room as the vilest blasphemy is outside of
the school-room. Pure English, with not an unnecessary
word, is beautiful. It excludes slang
and blasphemy. Again, the teacher should use
only pure English in the school-room, and more
than that, outside of the school-room, in his
every-day conversation.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Deception</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It is a well established fact that everyone
should be truthful, but to the teacher this is all-important.
This does not imply merely that the
teacher must tell no falsehood but he must, also,
act no falsehood. There are teachers who never
tell a lie, but their actions often convey untruth;
such a teacher cannot expect his pupils to be
truthful in word or deed. Closely allied to this
is the common fault of deception. No teacher
can afford to deceive his pupils. If he has
promised his pupils something, he should see
that they get it. If some unavoidable occurrence
prevents this, it becomes necessary that the
teacher should explain the situation. Truthfulness
and frankness on the part of the teacher will
beget the same on the part of the pupil.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Associations</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>May a young man or woman who is teaching,
associate frequently with the opposite sex? No
one will attempt to deny that he or she may to a
limited extent. Evil results will follow when the
association becomes too frequent or too conspicuous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>even though it is what the average young
American calls “just for a good time.” If these
young teachers are teaching in a high school,
they will sow the seeds of free-for-all courtship
in their classes. Wise high school teachers, and
very often the upper grammar grade teachers,
know that this will surely harm the better interests
of work and progress, that it will also
breed the abominable habit among the pupils of
keeping late hours and being on the streets too
much. Association with the opposite sexes
among high school pupils is often romantic and
beautiful and cannot be condemned. It is not
our purpose to object unqualifiedly to this practice
but <i>safety</i> and <i>common sense</i> must be practiced,
and at no time can a teacher afford to act
with more discretion than in his associations.
The married teacher is relieved of this caution,
but even his associations and relations with his
lady teachers, mothers and often older pupils
must be carefully guarded and made only business-like.</p>

<p class='c008'>This introduces the question of the kind of
associates of the same sex a teacher should allow
in his company. The maxim, “The kind of companions
one has will reveal one’s character” answers
the question. A teacher must ignore no
one, but only those people whose characters are
above reproach should become his companions.
It is true, a teacher will, very often have questionable
pupils in his classes. Here the attitude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>should be plainly missionary. Every effort
should be made to improve the pupils’ conduct
and thereby reform their lives. Sometimes, it is
wise to have very objectional pupils removed
permanently from the school. Their influence
on the other pupils may overbalance the good
done in saving them.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Example</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The effect of example upon the pupils is remarkable,
for no one can doubt but that example
strongly influences standards of morality. In
like manner the effect of the teacher’s life in
establishing higher or lower standards of morality
is influenced by the associates which he selects
from the masses. A teacher should select such
associations and companions that his pupils will
be influenced for the highest possible good. A
teacher should make it a positive rule never to
associate with any one whose companionship
would cause an unwholesome influence upon any
of his pupils. The opportunities of the teacher
are large in the selection of his society. He is in
line to choose the best; it is open to him. He
should choose to be a part of the highest and best
society and then should make it his province, his
duty and privilege to help mould and shape the
social standards, and do all he can to uplift and
better the lives of those with whom he comes in
contact.</p>

<p class='c008'>Speaking of the child, Arthur Holmes says:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“Imitation is his most universal instinct. What
he sees others do he will do naturally and unthinkingly.
It is as futile to teach honesty and
to act dishonestly before a child as it is to heap
water in a sieve. The nervous mechanism of the
child is as hopeless and as helpless as a wireless
receiver to the influence of Hertzian waves.”<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The teacher should not neglect those who are
worthy, but poor. Among them he may find
his best associates and friends. He should not
seek to escape the responsibilities that will accompany
his dealings with the less desirable
elements of society; he should look down upon
and ignore none; he should touch elbows with
those who are his intellectual superiors and surpass
him in strength of character; he should not
lower himself by stooping to that which is below
the moral standard, but in association with the
masses he must elevate them, and lead them forward,
ever remembering, that as he points to a
standard moral code as a sign board, he himself
must lead the way.</p>

</div>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Idleness</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>“Idleness leads to vice,” is a truth that the
teacher should ponder who spends his Saturdays
and Sundays, and his summer vacations in idleness,
spending what he has earned during the
winter. Work is honorable. It is commendable
for a teacher to labor during the summer vacation.
He may go to the Summer School, but if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>he does not do so, he should find other work.
The so-called rest at summer resorts and the seaside
may mean only idleness and evil. The
teacher whose life is worth while will have no
time to waste on Saturdays.</p>

<p class='c008'>Three of the most disputed social activities
are dancing, card playing and pool, including
billiards. Much has been said as to the rightness
and wrongness of these actions and still doubt
exists. The very fact that doubt exists should
satisfy the teacher that he cannot indulge in them,
and still do the greatest amount of good in his
community. It may not be that dancing in itself
is wrong, but the past unmistakably gives evidence
of the fact that evil attends the dance. The
modern dance is disgusting to say nothing about
its evil influence. The author is a promoter of
æsthetic dancing. Such recreation properly
supervised possesses great value. Dancing as a
part of physical education, under a competent
director, is quite another thing from the social or
public dance to which hundreds of young people
go, not for physical education, to be sure, but for
worse than idle pastime. The teacher must carefully
discriminate here. He should shun the
social and public dance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Perhaps less dispute attends card playing as
an evil. It is conceded as such by all right thinking
persons. Every one knows how easily gambling
results from card playing. There are numbers
of cases on record of lives wasted and
crimes committed over the card table as well as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>in pool and billiard rooms. Cards, pool and billiards
are tools of indolence; they are evil and
spread ruin in their wake. No teacher who cares
for the boys and girls under his instruction and
guidance will dance, play cards, pool or billiards.
He, too, will not play to excess checkers,
chess, dice, or kindred games. There are too
many good books to read from which the teacher
can gain inspiration and knowledge to <i>waste</i>
time playing either of the above or any similar
games. A word must be added relative to
gambling or betting. Both are evils and have
a bad influence upon the lives of the young. The
wise teacher will refrain from them.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Intemperance</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Reference has been made to intoxication which
is intemperance, but intemperance is a much
broader term and implies much more than getting
drunk. It is well not to think of intemperance
as belonging only to the use of intoxicating
beverages. Every pleasurable activity is liable
to be carried to excess. Teachers often need
relaxation from the wearisome routine of school-room
duty. When seeking rest and relief in legitimate
recreation care must be taken to avoid
excess.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even in matters of food and drink, dress and
social pleasures this caution is needed. The
teacher with common sense knows where to draw
the line. One can be intemperate in many things,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>always to his own harm. In passing, the definition
of intemperance will indicate just where the
thoughtful teacher must stop not to become intemperate.
Intemperance is a want of moderation
or self-restraint; indulging of any appetite
or passion to excess.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Honesty</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Honesty is commonly thought of as trustworthiness
in the conduct of business dealings, as
opposed to fraud and cheating. It is all that and
much more. It implies sincerity, uprightness,
truth, honor, integrity, justice, chastity, decency,
propriety, virtue and frankness. The word honesty
implies much, and there is too great danger
that the teacher practice it in its common meaning
only, forgetting that its application is broad.
It is very essential that he should not overlook
any of its implications. A teacher cannot be said
to be honest when he merely returns a dollar’s
worth of service for a dollar. That does not
exactly constitute honesty, though it may seem
to do so. The teacher who shirks a duty, which
he should do, because he finds it is not in his
province is like the man who did not pay his
street car fare because the conductor forgot to
call upon him for his ticket. He argued that it
was the conductor’s duty to call for it but honesty
demands that he should have paid it.</p>

<p class='c008'>A teacher should be sincere; he should do
nothing for effect. All his actions should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>genuine, arising from true motives. The term
upright is indeed vague. In its usual meaning it
signifies an adherence to moral principles. It
can be easily understood and applied, if the
teacher will remember to admonish his pupils
not to do anything which he would not do himself.
If the teacher undertakes to teach a moral
principle, he must first live it himself and then
he will have weight in his arguments for righteousness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Honor is that trait of character which holds
one to the practice of all the laws of the strictest
moral code. The teacher whose integrity cannot
be questioned is the teacher who has fulfilled, in
his life, all those demands that are set forth in the
laws of the Master Teacher. He has lived up to
the Golden Rule. Justice demands that all shall
be given their rights. The teacher can do no
better than to be just to all. When one has decided
notions of right and wrong upon the basis
of results in the lives of his fellows, he has
reached the exact idea of propriety. Virtue is
a broad term, but a word that is significant. That
life is virtuous whose every deed promotes the
common good.</p>

<p class='c008'>A teacher should not practice Sunday honesty—that
kind of honesty which works under certain
conditions and lapses at intervals. Everyone,
no doubt, is inclined to reach high water marks
of absolute truthfulness, and must beware of
lapses into error, even falling below the ordinary
standards of every day life. The honesty that is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>commendable is clean, out-in-the-open honesty
that is always active, not simply when great
issues are at stake. No other profession demands
honesty more than that of the teacher. His attitude
here must be real, not affected. If there is
pretence or sham, the first to become aware of it
will be the pupil; and the effect upon him is that
he loses confidence in the teacher who should be
his model.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Temper</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The question of temper should not be omitted
from a full discussion of a teacher’s moral code.
How often has a teacher boasted to a friend or
fellow-teacher that he indulged himself in a
frenzy of temper before his school, thereby
“scaring the wits out of the pupils” and remarked
further that the pupils feared him thereafter for
a week. Such an action on the part of a teacher
is almost criminal. A teacher cannot afford to
lower his dignity by such methods. While no
attempt is being made to discuss methods at this
point, for they will be discussed in following
chapters, yet it is the aim to point out those immoral
actions from which a teacher should be
free. It is foolish for anyone to allow his temper
to get away from his control. A teacher should
cultivate an amiable disposition. It is <i>never</i>
necessary to permit one’s temper to override his
common sense.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When I taught school, there were many
times when the indifference, stupidity, flippancy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>or silliness of the class brought me to such a
pitch of rage, that I dared not trust myself to
speak. I would clutch the arms of my chair, and
swallow foam until I felt complete self-command;
then I would speak with quiet gravity.
The boys all saw what was the matter with me,
and learned something not in the book.”

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Curiosity</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>In passing, it might be well to mention the not
uncommon fault of meddling. The teacher’s
province is the school and all its attendant activities.
It will not make him more efficient to
know the common affairs of every family of his
school. He will be no better off if he knows all
the happenings of the neighborhood, the village
or city-block. Many times it is necessary for the
teacher to repress a pupil who is prone to be a
news monger. Frequently, teachers plunge
themselves into serious difficulties by meddling
in affairs that do not concern their school. Such
difficulties are unfortunate and always weaken
the teacher’s ability to govern his school.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Questionable Acts</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It has been assumed that all those actions from
which evil only may result, are contrary to the
standards of the moral code. Consequently, some
deeds which the teacher commonly does not consider
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>as questionable activities will be discussed.
No lengthy treatment will be given them since
common sense—the safe standard for the teacher—will
help decide the correctness of the ideas set
forth. No teacher can afford, in school or out, to
make unkind remarks about the poor, the aged,
the weak-minded, the crippled, the peculiar, the
poorly dressed, the tramp, the gypsy, the prisoner,
or that unfortunate whose appetite is beyond
his control and causes him to become drunken.
The teacher is an agent who is expected to help,
to lift to higher planes of life. Frequently,
thoughtless teachers have joined pupils in jeering
at a beggar and thereby created a habit in
some child of making sport of the unfortunate.
The author calls to mind the elevating influence
of a little woman who, when the boys pelted a
hungry tramp with snow-balls, took him into the
warm room and shared with him her luncheon
and sent him on his way happier in heart because
he had met a kind-hearted woman. Who knows
but that this act of kindness may have helped to
turn the tramp from his vagrant life to a life of
usefulness? A teacher cannot lower his standards
of life by helping the aged, the poor, the
weak, the fallen. A good deed is never lost.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Neatness and Cleanliness</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>What is the influence of the teacher—man or
woman—whose clothing is untidy, hair and
scalp unclean, finger nails untrimmed and filled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>with dirt? There need be no discussion; the
prudent teacher knows the answer. The teacher
who is attempting to follow a standard of morals
will not allow his body to be unclean and unkempt.
His attire, though it may not be in the
latest style, will be neat and clean; his teeth
will be clean, his finger nails well kept, and his
shoes clean and polished and every detail will
evidence his careful attention. Such a teacher
will take active daily exercise, will not forget a
daily walk, that will lead out to some haunt of
Nature where a new lesson is in store for the observing
teacher. Nature has a lesson for him
every day of the year.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is safe to assume that the teacher who guards
carefully his actions in the school, out of school,
in his every day life, and above all when hundreds
of miles away from home, is a safe teacher.
He need not give stated lectures on morals. His
life and deeds will be monitors to the youth
under his tutelage. Moral education is not
knowledge, it is life. Therefore, a teacher cannot
educate pupils by stated and set lessons in
morals, if he has none himself, but on the other
hand, his life can be a standard of morals in itself
and thus furnish a living model for action to
those about him. A teacher has no right to teach
good conduct and morals, or any attributes of a
moral nature, if he is guilty of repeated immoral
acts, open or hidden. It must be remembered
that morality is not inherent, but developed.
From this it can be clearly deduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>that this moral development receives direction
from the moral life of the teacher.</p>

<p class='c008'>The young teacher, who on his first day enters
the school-room and is face to face, for the first
time with the responsibility of his profession,
casts about for a model teacher. He will find
many successful teachers whose lives are above
reproach, even some of his own colleagues may
be those who will influence him for great good.
He may be compelled to look back to a teacher
who has been a vital factor in his development.
However, he is young, and is surrounded by a
world of temptation, and his searching mind
need not go far until it can single out a teacher
whose life is very questionable, but who is
popular, receives a good salary, and possibly
secures the best school positions. These are poor
standards by which to measure real life and success,
but the young teacher wants popularity,
money, and a good position. Real success is
stable and lasting. The teacher with a questionable
reputation, will doubtless before the end of
his career find his proper level. To measure a
man by his apparent success is not always safe.
It is his character that counts in the end. Time
may be necessary in which to estimate moral
worth correctly, but the effort to truly weigh a
person’s character is well spent.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>The Teacher’s Religion</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The inquiring teacher by this time may have
asked, “What about a teacher’s religion?” A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>teacher should know his Bible, be a regular communicant
of some church, and a Sunday School
worker. Fanaticism must be avoided. But the
sane and mellowing influence of religion has a
great effect upon character. No teacher should
make it a practice to inject his religious ideas
into his school work. His every day life should
indicate his obedience to the Master Teacher.
He must not attack any religious denomination
as that is not his province. Some child may be
offended or over influenced by his views. The
tenets of every child’s church are sacred to him
and the teacher should not attack them. Often
it is argued that a teacher should not teach a
Sunday School class. If the teacher does not
find it too great an addition to his already heavy
work, there can be no good reason why he may
not teach in the Sunday School.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is well to discriminate carefully between a
moral person and an apparently religious person.
Too often it is assumed that a pious person is of
necessity a safe moral guide. Sometimes unfortunately
the teacher who appears religious is not
morally sound.</p>

<p class='c008'>True religion includes an approved morality.
But, it must be understood that teaching religion
does not necessarily indicate that good morals
are being taught. The author does not mean to
criticise the Sunday School, or even the Church—they
are great and effective institutions—but
they are failing to teach morals as they should.
The school teacher has a great work to do at this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>point. The final admonition to the teacher is,
have a standard moral code, <i>live it</i>, and in pointing
others to it as a signboard of life, <i>be sure to
heed it always yourself</i>.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Aesthetic Appreciation</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>A requisite of the teacher that cannot be overlooked
is that he must have a love for all that is
good and beautiful: an æsthetic appreciation.
The teacher must appreciate and actually participate
in the noblest, best and most beautiful
which the world possesses in song and story, in
conversation and poem, in landscape and sky, in
art and music. The sky with floating clouds, or
when clear or starbedecked, a silver moon hanging
low over a dark-rimmed horizon, a towering
cathedral against a sunset sky, a brook stealing
its way across a meadow, a mountain torrent,
a rainbow, the shadow and sheen in the depths of
the forest, a placid river on its way to the sea, a
bird song, a meadow, a field of ripening grain, a
flower-hedged roadway, a path through the valley
and into the depths of a wood where it winds
at will among the mossy trunks of trees, over
tufts of moss, beside quiet pools, through rustling
leaves—all these and many more objects in nature
hold in store inspiring and uplifting lessons of
life. No teacher can contemplate these beauties
and not possess a nobler soul. Contact with
Nature’s most beautiful and best will strengthen
his love for the beautiful and will help him to
keep the hearts of his pupils attuned to the helpful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>sights and sounds that go to make up their
surroundings.</p>

<p class='c008'>The teacher who delights in the beautiful will
find himself easily winning the interests and attention
of his pupils. Children are born admirers
of the beautiful.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Constitutionally, he functions æsthetically
just as really as he does socially, although not to
the same extent. Very early in his history he
manifests delight in beauty. The nature of these
reactions will be explained as we proceed with
the chapter. Because of them, education calls
for the development of this aspect of the child’s
nature, and ethical culture demands its moralization.
Morality is especially concerned with
æsthetic development, since there is an intimate
relation existing between the beautiful and the
good.”<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>No teacher can have an appreciative love for
all that is beautiful and good and not love children.
The most beautiful thing in all the world
is the unfolding life of a child. Who has not
stopped by the side of the cradle and pushed
aside a curl to look upon the face of a sleeping
baby, whose long eyelashes are sweeping over
cheeks aglow with beauty, the whole face portraying
childhood’s charm. The first tottering
steps of a child are deeply interesting. His gleeful
prattle, his silver laughter are cheering to
the most benighted. Could ever a human being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>think of becoming a teacher who does not love
children above all else?</p>

<p class='c008'>Every teacher should love and appreciate good
literature and good music, and all that is beautiful
in the arts. Whatever is cultural is æsthetic.
The beautiful, the true, the good are all æsthetic
and therefore profitable. Each day the teacher
should renew and reinspire his soul and life by
contact with all that surrounds him that is
æsthetic. He must abhor wrong and love right.
His character will then be strong and his life
filled with success, joy and peace.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Willingness to Learn</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>A requisite absolutely essential to the teacher
is open-mindedness. He should, of course, be
stable; he should not be influenced by every
theory and idea that comes to his attention in his
associations and reading, but he must be ready
and willing to learn. The teacher will grow by
experience who can say, “I want to learn more,”
but he will just as surely fossilize, if he thinks,
“I know it all.” No mind can grow if it draws
its conclusions only to be in harmony with those
already framed. Sometimes, a pupil will suggest
a thought, or even a truth, that has never
come to the teacher’s attention. How much better
it is to welcome the idea or truth, and so inform
the pupil, than to ignore it even though it is
of value just because it came from one who is
inferior. The barefoot urchin may know secrets
the teacher has never learned.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Worry</h3>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The happy quality of mind that shuns worry
is well worth a teacher’s cultivation. Worry
makes inroads into a teacher’s health. Sometimes,
the unthoughtful teacher concludes that
work is impairing health when in truth it is
worry. It is true, many situations need careful
consideration, but never worry. Worry never
yet solved a difficulty. Cultivate a happy mood,
resolve that where there is a will there is a way,
and all the school problems will seem less difficult
after that resolution.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Attitude Toward Criticism</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Closely akin to worry is over-sensitiveness to
criticism. The following anonymous article appeared
in a college paper some time ago. It is
apt and contains much truth. “‘Say nothing, do
nothing, be nothing, then you will escape criticism’,
goes an old saying. Could anything ring
truer? The most maligned men and women are
those who are doing the most and doing it in a
conscientious manner. Analyze the person who
boasts of never being criticised and you will find
nothing. Some persons, to escape criticism take
a middle course; first catering toward this side,
then leaning toward the other. They call it tact;
it is really moral cowardice. Others allow the
shafts of criticism to break down their self-respect,
their confidence in their own ability. This,
too, is the wrong attitude. Criticism is a recognition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>that you are of sufficient importance to
stimulate remarks from someone and besides, the
right kind of criticism is always constructive.
The other kind, oh, it comes mostly from the
class who escape criticism.”</p>

<p class='c008'>While the above is true it needs careful
thought. It should not be forgotten that criticism
is often justly given, and means that the
ability of some one is not up to the standard or
that they are failing to do their best. The
teacher, however, who does his duty as he knows
it best, need never allow criticism to give him
any trouble or worry. It may mean only that he
is doing something worth talking about.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Self-confidence</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Some teachers possess all those elements that
contribute to successful teaching, except self-confidence.
Yet too much of that quality is more
dangerous than helpful. Self-confidence in
one’s work when the elements of preparation are
lacking is foolhardy. When a teacher has given
himself that preparation that he knows is necessary
and has done his best to possess the qualities
that should dominate a teacher, he has a right to
have self-confidence. Not alone is it necessary
that he should be self-confident, but it is highly
essential that he should show it. He knows what
he can do and he should expect good results; if
he does this he can not miss success. Success
crowns his work who has self-confidence in possessed
ability.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Common Sense</h3>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Too often the teacher is admonished to practice
common sense. This is an indefinite term
and to many young and inexperienced teachers
it means nothing. Should they wish to practice
common sense they would not be able to do so,
because they can not place a correct construction
upon the term. The teacher who observed that
one of the boys sat still in his seat and looked into
space more than at his book, and then reprimanded
the boy because he failed to learn his
lesson, did not use common sense. Another
teacher in the same high school observed the
same boy, went to him privately and inquired in a
friendly way, if there could be any wrong from
which the boy was suffering. He was told by the
boy that he was worrying because he believed he
had tuberculosis and furthermore that his father
mistreated him. This teacher used common
sense, and also the much recommended “tact,”
another indefinite thing. This teacher sympathized
with the boy and sought to remove the
obstacles. Success crowned the teacher’s efforts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another illustration may serve to explain the
term, “common sense.” The teacher who scolded
the boys for smoking cigarettes, and thereby
won their ill will and intensified the habit, did
not use common sense. Another teacher who
won the confidence and good will of the
boys and then confidentially explained to them
the evil results of smoking, used common sense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>and tact. Did he succeed in getting all the boys
to stop smoking? No. Nor is there any tactful
teacher who will succeed with all, but he persuaded
a great many of the boys to stop smoking.
At this point so many teachers fail just because
the first effort, or even continued effort does not
save every boy. They condemn their methods
and become discouraged. An evil as great as
smoking can not be abolished in one year.
Probably, it can not ever be entirely eradicated,
but patience and faithful service will finally
reach results almost incredible. These illustrations
should serve to explain one concrete use of
common sense and tact. The observant and
thoughtful teacher finds instances every day
where common sense and tact are used to advantage.
It is the object of this Course, in the presentation
of many tactful methods, to increase
the teacher’s store of “Common Sense” plans of
discipline.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Entering the Child’s Activities</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It is, indeed, the discreet teacher who can
place himself upon the level of the child. There
is no teacher who can expect to render to the
child the service due him, if he does not enter
into his life. With propriety can the teacher be
one among the children. A boy with the boys or
a girl with the girls. It is imperative to enter
into their interests. The suggestion to enter into
the lives of the pupils, has furnished many a
teacher with the means whereby he saved the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>wayward boy or girl. The teacher who places
himself above the children, either in the grades
or in the high school, by word and action, loses
his influence for good and useful service. Such
a teacher cannot be a true teacher. Many of the
uplifting truths of his own life, if he may possess
such, fail to impress his pupils. Children of
every school age love the teacher who tactfully
enters their activities and games—enters them in
such a way as to forget that he is a teacher, and
his pupils subordinates, but as if all are children
having a good time. The Chinese sage,
Mencius, said, “The great man is he who does
not lose his child’s heart.” Big boys and girls
always love and admire the teacher who can
enter into their sports, games and athletic activities.
It pays men teachers to have some knowledge
of athletic sports.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even a woman can do much in promoting
athletic sports. The benefit is two-fold; first,
the health of the teacher demands the exercise
which athletics affords; secondly, the pupils can
be much more easily controlled by the teacher
who enters their sports and activities. There is
a world of knowledge to be gained by entering
into the child’s life. Needless should be the
caution that the teacher should not allow himself
to grow old in spirit. The teacher whose years
may have reached the half century mark can still
have “that youthful spirit” and that sprightly
manner that will fire youth to its fullest activity.
Such a teacher will never grow really old. Of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>him it may well be said, that he grows younger
with the years until he reaches eternal youth.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Cheerfulness</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It is often said that childhood is life’s happiest
period. Where then is the teacher who comes
in contact with child life daily, who cannot be
happy, youthful and ever ready to bestow the
cheerfulness, of a helpful life? The happy-minded
teacher will never pass his pupils anywhere
without leaving with them a sense of his
kindly interest. He knows when to enter the
child’s world to share his joys—and his are real
joys—when to sympathize with him in sorrow.
The teacher whose life has become bitter, and
who no longer can be happy-minded and cheerful,
should leave the profession. Everywhere is
needed cheer; no place can be made better by
gloom, but especially should a companion of
children be optimistic.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Responsibility</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Responsibility is an essential requirement of
the teacher. He must be absolutely trustworthy.
The teacher who shoulders his responsibility,
will not neglect the least part of his work
because he believes he is underpaid. Should he
know that the welfare of a child demands his
attention, outside of school hours, he should not
fail to aid the child, though it be really no part
of his school duties. The rights of the pupils
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>will be guarded as sacred by the responsible
teacher. He, too, will care for the property of
the school as though it were his, and even more
so, for he is entrusted with its care. The greatest
safety for any school is a conscientious teacher
under whom parents can place their children
for moral, physical and spiritual instructions.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Courage</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>To be fearless in the performance of one’s
duty is no easy matter. Least of all for the
teacher. Often in a community, the school is
the only active institution, during the school
year. Its influence reaches every home in the
community through the children. Its every activity
is discussed by the well-meaning, as well
as by the unthoughtful and unscrupulous, the
latter often criticising without the slightest assurance
that they are correct in their views. The
teacher must stand by with a fearless attitude.
It is assumed that he has done what he believes
to be right—his own life being simple and his
moral standards at least no lower than those of
his patrons. The teacher must possess all the
requisites of the true teacher to be able to stand
against every view that may become current.
He must even decide to his hurt in order to maintain
the right when criticism and censure become
slander and falsehood. A teacher must be
himself, not an imitator. His decisions must be
firm, yet kind. He must constantly hold in view
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>the final end in every action, which end is best
for the welfare of the child. A teacher who is
fickle, doubts his ability, hesitates between opinions,
is swayed by every criticism that comes his
way, seeks advice from those who are not capable
of giving it and finally deviates from the
right, will not succeed. He cannot be fearless.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Sensible Dressing</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It seems almost useless to say that a strong
element in the teacher’s qualifications is his
ability to discriminate carefully about his attire.
A certain grade teacher, who, as far as her principal
could judge, possessed every attribute that
would constitute a successful teacher, was wholly
uncultivated in her tastes regarding dress. So
peculiar and often ridiculous was her attire that
she became the laughing stock of the community
and finally her pupils, though they respected
her, made remarks about her appearance. She
found her ability to control her pupils weakened.
Aside from a sensible choice of dress, it
is not to be overlooked that a teacher sets an example
for neatness and cleanliness when he attends
to the careful selection of his attire and
then sees that his person and clothing are always
neat, clean and well kept. A teacher cannot afford
to dress so as to draw special attention to
his clothes. He should follow the dictates of
fashion as long as that is in keeping with good
common sense. To women teachers, this is an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>important point. It is to be feared should a
woman teacher follow every whim of fashion,
she would have little time left for her actual
duties. Plain, sensible clothing that allows
freedom and ease becomes a teacher—man or
woman.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>The Teacher’s Home</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It is well to say something about the teacher’s
home, or if the teacher is boarding, something
about his room. His immediate surroundings
often reflect his personal tastes as clearly as does
his attire. All eyes are on the teacher and his domestic
policy cannot escape criticism. Not long
ago in one of the foremost school communities
of Ohio lived a principal of a high school whose
home was little better than a hovel. A stranger
called there one day and found the front yard
very untidy, several calves were running loose
there, while rubbish, such as barrels, broken
dishes, tin cans and a profusion of coal ashes
were in evidence. He was greeted by several
children who, even to this lover of children,
proved almost repulsive. Each child was dressed
in filthy clothing, with face and hands unwashed
and the hair matted with dirt. The
father came next—a principal of a small high
school—whose appearance was no better than
that of the children. Instead of neat and cleanly
attire, his clothing was ragged and soiled, not
even put on properly. As the stranger spoke to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>the worthy principal he could look into a kind
of shed room near the house, in which a woman,
no doubt the mother of the children, was washing.
She too, was unkempt and unclean. Her
surroundings were so disorderly and unclean
that health was in danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stranger’s curiosity was aroused and by
a clever investigation he learned that this particular
high school was notorious, far and near,
for its rude boys and girls. He learned that just
about six weeks before his visit, thirteen of the
high school boys had been before the Juvenile
Court for various offenses, and that many more
should have been summoned. This was an enormous
percentage out of a possible enrollment
of one hundred and twenty pupils. Could this
principal’s untidy home and surroundings have
played any part in this condition? Most certainly.
Any teacher who will allow himself to
live in such a home cannot without great injustice
be retained as a teacher. Just as he allowed
his surroundings to become so wretched he
would allow those with whom he daily came in
contact to become morally wrong. This man
who cared nothing for the beauty of his home
and its environment lacked those finer senses that
make for useful lives. His influence was demoralizing.
A teacher’s home surroundings and
tastes are sure indices to his state of culture and
refinement.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Work</h3>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>No teacher whose labors are to be crowned
with success and happiness, the results that
count, must be afraid of work. Work is the
secret of success. Its example tells. The teacher
who can work willingly and cheerfully and
who shows that he is happy when he has something
to do needs never to complain that the
pupils do not work. It is good for a teacher to
give the impression that he does home work,
studies gladly, is interested in every lesson that
he hears, and knows his subject thoroughly.
Such a teacher will have pupils who study with
zest, who utilize their spare moments and above
all, pupils who really are interested in their
work.</p>

<p class='c008'>A teacher must not approach any task in a
half-hearted way, but with all the strength and
energy he is able to command. Happiness and
success and a helpful optimism come from
active participation in life’s battles. The individual
who likes work, likes play, likes to read,
loves Nature, and thereby finds diversity and recreation
in the activities of life will not find the
work of the teacher too taxing. After a hard
lesson in mathematics, a real, live novel—written
by a modern novelist—will often rest the
mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>A walk after a hard day in school is restful.</p>

<p class='c008'>The writer recalls a splendid, little, effective
teacher who after a hard and successful day in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>the school-room would go with her pupils to hunt
flowers, to row or ride, would often work in the
garden, sometimes play baseball, and could indulge
in a snowballing that sent everyone home
with a feeling of good fellowship. She had
some silver threads in her hair and her years
numbered more than a half century, still her
cheeks were ruddy and her eyes keen. She was
young in spirit and the children loved her. Her
efficiency as a teacher was never questioned.
Many are the men and women who are making
the world better because she trained them when
they were boys and girls. Work interspersed
with the proper exercise and recreation will <i>not</i>
injure any teacher’s health. Worry as a rule
is the undermining force at work. The teacher
who attempts to get along without exercise will
sometime in his career, though not always at
first, become a miserable failure. Exercise is
necessary. It should be taken daily in the open
air. Exercise and open air are two elixirs of
youth. The teacher needs them.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>The Teacher’s Health</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>There can be no question about a teacher’s
health being of the greatest importance to effective
and cheerful work. No fear as to health
need be experienced by the teacher who takes
plenty of exercise and gets out into God’s great
out-of-doors for fresh air. There is no excuse
for the teacher who is cross and mistreats the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>pupils and scowls at their every mistake or mischievous
prank, and then justifies her attitude by
saying, “I do not feel well.” It should be an infallible
rule with every teacher to make no attempt
to teach while ill. It is far better for a
child to miss a day or two of school than to be
subjected to the rule of a cross, peevish, fretful
teacher. Only the teacher buoyant with good
health should be allowed in the school-room.
Little needs to be said about the many chronic
diseases which are contagious, such as tuberculosis,
and are easily transmitted to the pupils
by infected teachers. It is a teacher’s plain duty
to keep himself in good health.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>System</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The ability to have order and system in school
work will go a great way toward making the
work easier and more effective. Method and
order are great time savers. A teacher is an
architect. For every task there must be a plan.
Each lesson must have its place. Each step its
reason. A teacher who formulates and plans
his work will accomplish much more than the
teacher who relies upon circumstances to point
out to him his method of procedure. To be
careless, haphazard and aimless means to fail.</p>

<p class='c008'>A teacher can learn a valuable lesson from
studying any great factory where labor and time
saving devices are employed. In addition to
these, every means of system and order are used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>to secure the greatest effectiveness of energy put
forth. Many an individual has acquired an
education in spare moments, by putting system
into his work, and thus saved time and energy
which could be expended in securing an education.
Unsystematic school work is a waste of
energy. The teacher should have a time for
everything, as well as a place for everything.
Begin school on time, close on time. Regularity
will bring good results. The slogan of many
advertisers is, “Do it now.” Time lost can rarely
ever be regained.</p>

<p class='c008'>The prudent teacher will use studied methods—methods
that apply to the lesson and class at
hand. He who uses correct methods in the
school-room will doubtless use right methods in
his study, and further will practice regular
habits in his life outside of the school-room.
The regular habits of a teacher in all of his activities
will always be reproduced in the work of
his pupils.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is true, that there are scores of “method
books” claiming to give needed “directions” for
every detail of school work. It is foolish for a
teacher to rely upon such advice. Every so-called
method is needful and helpful, but a teacher
must study his class and his lessons and apply
just such methods as his experience teaches him
will secure the best and most lasting results.
How often can one visit certain schools and note
the effect of the weekly or monthly advent of
the teacher’s paper. Such teachers have no tried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>methods of their own but each week or month
they try out methods only to find many of them
unsuited to their needs. Such procedures prevent
continuous progress. They are like a ship
without a rudder; they will finally run upon the
rocks of failure.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is easy for a teacher to develop a narrowness
in his tastes that forbids him to seek proper
variation in his work. The more devoted a
teacher is the more he needs diversions quite disconnected
from his professional duties. The
freshness of mind gained by digressions from
school routine is as necessary as the preparation
of lesson material itself.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Discrimination</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The ability to discriminate carefully is one of
the teacher’s most valuable qualities. The discriminating
and analytic mind is most indispensable
to good teaching. To see things in their
proper light, to place a fair estimate upon anything
or any situation, to give due credit where it
belongs and reserve an opinion as long as doubt
remains, are needful qualities of the discriminating
mind. Such a mind is broad and liberal.
The small details of life will not over influence
such a mind. It is able to discern between the
trivial, the common-place, and the useful and
valuable in every action. Deliberation is a
fundamental antecedent of discrimination. The
hasty mind jumping at conclusions, before every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>detail has been examined and weighed, often
plunges itself into confusion. The discriminating
teacher is able to rid himself of the bondage
of annoyances and petty grievances and rise
above difficulties, thereby gaining that magnanimity
of spirit that leads to achievement and
success.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Judgment</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The ability to form a quick and impartial
judgment and to act upon that judgment is even
more important than to discriminate without
bias. Perhaps, it is only another way of saying
that one should be discriminating. Still, there
is this distinction: a quick and clear judgment
can only be reached by a discriminating mind.
To lose sight of one’s own interests or one’s self
is a basis for rare judgment. It is necessary to
lay aside all prejudice to be able to discriminate
so as to reach a clear and unbiased judgment.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Concentration</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Concentration of mind and purpose go hand
in hand with discrimination and judgment.
The teacher must be able to concentrate his mind
upon his work so as to get from it its fullest
meaning and thereby make no mistake in the
presentation of any subject. To concentrate the
mind in every instance means a successful completion
of every task undertaken. It goes without
question that such qualities in the teacher
will make pupils take a delight in the thorough
preparation of their work.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Patience</h3>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Patience, unfaltering patience, has won the
victory for many a teacher. How often has a
teacher labored hard to present a lesson, only to
return and find no good results from the effort.
The teacher may not always be at fault. Some
child may have grasped every detail, another
under the same instruction, not even the larger
facts; but we all know that not all children are
equal in the ability to comprehend. The conditions
that enable one to learn may not have been
so advantageous for another. It is not wise to
become disheartened and scowl over the apparent
failure of a child. The teacher would fail if
the same conditions hindered him. If the teacher,
after being sympathetic and taking into consideration
the environment of the child, then discovers
indifference to studies, the time may have
come for firmer methods, but even then patience
will go a long way in obtaining results.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>The Teacher’s Social Life</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Another perplexing matter, hardly avoidable
by the teacher, but a factor that usually has a
marked effect upon his work, is his social life.
Just how far is it safe to enter into the social life
of the community? Should a teacher share in
the social life of his patrons? Yes. Carefully
discriminate how far this social activity may extend
without harming a teacher’s influence. A
teacher must take interest in the social life of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>community, so as to harm no one, not even himself,
and improve the community life about him.
Into some homes he can not go, but he must not
ignore or look down upon such homes. He
must <i>show</i> preference to none. Otherwise his
visits to certain homes will involve him in endless
gossip. Then, above all, it is a safe rule,
whenever and wherever he enters social life, to
say nothing about his pupils, his school work, or
his patrons. Some unthinking person may repeat
what he has said, and not intentionally misconstrue
his statements, thus causing him trouble
and weakening his influence. It is safer and far
better to make no remark at all about any
individual if one can not say something good.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Treating All Alike</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>A teacher must be friendly to all, even though
some are far beneath him socially and others
may spurn his friendship. His greetings should
be the same to all. Often a teacher discriminates
against the outcast and thus earns for himself
the reputation of being proud. To be friendly
to all does not mean that one must be an associate
of the outcast. It is a matter of expediency to
treat all alike so that one’s influence may work
for good and the uplift of the masses.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>A True Leader</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It is evident from the foregoing requisites of
the teacher that if he can acquire all the qualities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>set forth, he is a teacher who has himself under
control and can, first of all, discipline himself—a
condition that is necessary if the teacher expects
to control and discipline those under his
tutelage.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The well-trained man is the man whose
mind is stored with a fund of varied knowledge
which he can promptly command when the necessity
for it arises; he is the man who can keep
his attention upon the problem in hand as long as
necessary, and in the face of distraction; he is,
moreover, the man who, having paused long
enough to see the situation correctly and to bring
to bear upon it all the relevant knowledge he
possesses, acts thereon promptly and forcefully.”<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Can he square up to every qualification? If
so, he will be a true leader and teacher. It may
seem discouraging to be required to measure up
to so many requisites, but after all they will insure
true contentment and happiness—those
qualities that come only to the really prepared—and
lasting success will most certainly crown
the efforts of such a teacher.</p>

<p class='c008'>While it is true and right that every teacher
should demand his wages, still, it is almost a
crime for a teacher to measure his services by
the amount of his remuneration. The <i>true</i>
teacher’s services are rewarded by the good he
has done, by the useful lives that have grown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>under his beneficent teaching, by the services
rendered, by men and women, who as boys and
girls, have felt the influence of his life. Such
a reward is never ending. The good sown in
one life will transplant itself into another and
another long after the teacher has received his
final reward. The teacher’s recompense is not
measured by dollars and cents, but by the good
done to humanity.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Summary</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>1. The teacher’s is the noblest of all professions.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. The teacher’s service is a service to mankind,
moulding the child life, thereby shaping
the destinies of coming generations.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. The teacher must have the right motive for
teaching. His motive must be true service to
mankind. Should he not have such a motive, he
should leave the profession.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. The teacher must be thoroughly prepared—his
knowledge must be fresh and ready for
use. This will enable him to win the confidence
of his pupils and lessen the necessity for discipline.
In other words:</p>

<p class='c008'>(a) He must be educated and trained in a
Normal School, having at least one year of such
training. A college education, while not absolutely
necessary, is a very great asset.</p>

<p class='c008'>(b) He must be a lover of Nature. That is,
he should have a profound interest in all the
phenomena of Nature.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>(c) He must be a student of psychology since
it is a needful adjunct to the teacher’s education.
It is an interpretation of human nature; consequently,
it has value in understanding child life.
A teacher should read good texts in psychology
every year.</p>

<p class='c008'>(d) He must be a student. He should always
work over his lessons and read in subjects related
to the work in hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>(e) He must be a reader of good books bearing
upon the many phases of learning. Fiction
and poetry are real aids to a teacher’s preparation.</p>

<p class='c008'>(f) He must not be superficial. If he follows
slavishly books on method, he is shallow. Such
books are intended to suggest only. The discreet
teacher improves by every suggestion.</p>

<p class='c008'>(g) He must be a reader of the daily paper,
the magazine, and the teacher’s paper. They are
a part of his educational equipment. Only the
best should be read, and they not to the exclusion
of other literature.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. A teacher must possess the ability to teach.
Ability includes a natural fitness as well as
scholastic preparation.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. The first and greatest requisite of the
teacher is morality. Its simplest definition shows
that it deals with the rightness or wrongness of
any action. Those actions are immoral that are
followed by evil or demoralizing results. A
partial list of these follow and should be labeled,
“Don’ts for the Teacher.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>(a) Intoxication, fighting, gambling, visiting
places of doubtful character, associating with
persons whose characters are suspected, violating
the laws, breaking the Sabbath, swearing, blaspheming,
cheating, falsifying and lewd conduct
are immoral acts about which there can be no
question.</p>

<p class='c008'>(b) The use of tobacco in any form is immoral.
This is true, because only evil results
follow in many cases.</p>

<p class='c008'>(c) Gossiping and loafing are evils for anyone.
The teacher should avoid them.</p>

<p class='c008'>(d) The street-corner gang or the low-minded
crowd are not fit for the teacher’s company. He
should avoid them.</p>

<p class='c008'>(e) The so-called social gatherings are often
hotbeds for gossip. When they are such, men
and women teachers do well to avoid them.</p>

<p class='c008'>(f) “Smutty” stories, vicious “yarns” and
senseless stories as well as slang are objectionable.
The teacher should avoid them.</p>

<p class='c008'>(g) Attempts at humor at the expense of an
auditor should be avoided.</p>

<p class='c008'>(h) Tell no falsehood; act no falsehood.</p>

<p class='c008'>(i) Associate only with those whose influence
is for good. Unmarried teachers can not be too
thoughtful as to the extent of their associations,
with even the best of the opposite sex. It often
weakens influence and breeds unrestrained
“courting” in the upper grades and the high
school.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>(j) A teacher should avoid idleness. Duties
outside of school hours will be recreative.</p>

<p class='c008'>(k) The modern dance, public or private,
must be avoided by the conscientious teacher.</p>

<p class='c008'>(l) Card playing, pool and billiards are immoral.
They lead to gambling. A teacher’s
influence may cause someone else to gamble.
Checkers, chess, dice, and other “time killers”
should be practically avoided by the teacher.
Use leisure time in reading good books, or in
out-of-door exercise. Richer returns will accrue.</p>

<p class='c008'>(m) Intemperance includes much. The
teacher should investigate its province and refrain
from <i>all</i> intemperance.</p>

<p class='c008'>(n) The teacher must be honest in the strictest
sense. Honesty implies trustworthiness in
dealings, trustworthiness in business, trustworthiness
in all other conduct, sincerity, truth, uprightness,
honor, integrity, justice, chastity, decency,
propriety, virtue and frankness. Each is
so patent that it needs no discussion.</p>

<p class='c008'>(o) A teacher must always hold his temper
in restraint.</p>

<p class='c008'>(p) A teacher can not afford to meddle in the
affairs of others.</p>

<p class='c008'>(q) A teacher should not make fun of the
poor, the needy, the weak-minded, the crippled,
the aged, the peculiar, the poorly dressed, the
tramp, the gypsy, the prisoner, or even the intoxicated.</p>

<p class='c008'>(r) Often a teacher’s moral attitude is revealed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>by his attire. Neat and cleanly attire is
required of a teacher.</p>

<p class='c008'>(s) A teacher cannot afford to dress foppishly.</p>

<p class='c008'>(t) A teacher’s conduct away from home
should always be as good as when at home.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. No teacher can rightfully teach a moral
code if he is repeatedly guilty of any immoral
act, open or hidden.</p>

<p class='c008'>8. Often an immoral teacher seems successful;
but his work is unstable and cannot last. No
young teacher should let such show of success
influence him in the least.</p>

<p class='c008'>9. Morals and religion should not be confused.
Morality is a condition of religion. It does
not follow that one who claims to be religious
practices good morals.</p>

<p class='c008'>10. An important qualification of the teacher
is that he must love all that is good and beautiful.
He must have an æsthetic appreciation.
That includes a love for all in Nature as well as
the arts of man.</p>

<p class='c008'>11. A teacher must love children. They are
the most significant of all God’s creations.</p>

<p class='c008'>12. No teacher should worry. To do so undermines
health.</p>

<p class='c008'>13. Do not cease to do good because of criticism;
very often it means that the act criticised
is worth while.</p>

<p class='c008'>14. Common sense, often called tact, is a
teacher’s much needed qualification.</p>

<p class='c008'>15. Every teacher who wishes to accomplish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>the greatest good, will enter into the child’s life.
Live on a level with the child. That means
taking part in the child’s joys and sorrows, his
work and play.</p>

<p class='c008'>16. Athletic education is necessary for every
teacher. It has a two-fold value. It is a health
promoter. It aids in discipline.</p>

<p class='c008'>17. A teacher needs to be happy-minded,
young in spirit and gentle in manners.</p>

<p class='c008'>18. Responsibility should be felt by the teacher.</p>

<p class='c008'>19. In every activity—in every crisis—the
teacher must be fearless. He must not be dependent
upon some one else’s decisions but use
his own judgment and make his own decisions.</p>

<p class='c008'>20. The teacher must possess the ability to discriminate,
and to form clear and quick judgments.</p>

<p class='c008'>21. A teacher’s room at his boarding house or
his home should be neat and well kept.</p>

<p class='c008'>22. The gospel of work is safe for the teacher
whose efforts are to be crowned with success.</p>

<p class='c008'>23. It is necessary for health’s sake to take
daily exercise out-of-doors.</p>

<p class='c008'>24. A teacher must keep in good health. An
unhealthy teacher has no business in the school-room.</p>

<p class='c008'>25. System and order are qualifications of the
teacher that make for success.</p>

<p class='c008'>26. A prudent teacher will use studied methods
and plans, and not let the occasion suggest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>the procedure. Avoid teaching according to
method books and teachers’ papers only.</p>

<p class='c008'>27. Concentration of mind and purpose are
essential to the successful teacher.</p>

<p class='c008'>28. Patience is a requisite for every teacher’s
work.</p>

<p class='c008'>29. A teacher should be religious. Refrain
from talking religion in the school-room. Attack
no pupil’s religion. Sunday School can be
attended, with profit, by the teacher. He should
judge for himself whether or not he should teach
a Sunday School class.</p>

<p class='c008'>30. The teacher must exercise care as to the
extent of his social activities. He should not
exclude himself from social gatherings, but
should use great caution about what he says of
others.</p>

<p class='c008'>31. Finally, the teacher must be a true leader.
His reward must not be measured in dollars and
cents, but by results from service rendered.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>PART TWO<br /> <br /><span class='sc'>The School</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>After so thoroughly discussing the requisites
of the teacher—those elements
that will make success possible—it is
expedient that a short discussion should
follow on the school, the child’s home during
his school career. The influence of a well kept
building and premises is far reaching. Some
years ago a stranger stopped in a western town,
where he was very favorably impressed with the
neatness of the homes and their surroundings.
Upon investigation he found a small school
building, but to his surprise, the humble, little
three-room school was beautiful in its setting,
and ivy clung to its brick walls making them
look cheerful. There were flower beds in the
yards and neatly kept gravel walks. Over the
gate were vines. The windows had neat blinds
and snowy-white curtains. The stranger asked
to be admitted into the school building. On the
inside he saw the same careful attention to neatness.
The floors were clean, the walls tinted and
adorned with excellent pictures and mottoes.
The furniture showed no marks of defacement.
With this little school as an example, the
stranger could understand why the little town
presented such a neat appearance. He further
learned that the people, including the boys and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>girls, were a quiet peace-loving people whose
culture was far above the average. The little,
well kept school may not have been the only influence,
but it played a great part in shaping the
ideas of the town folk. It must not be overlooked,
however, that no matter in what condition
the building and its surroundings may be, the
success of the teacher will depend largely upon
his preparation, ability and those other essentials
and qualities that make the true teacher. Still
it cannot be denied that the surroundings of the
child are important factors in his development.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Clean Surroundings</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It follows that a teacher who is trying to meet
every requirement of the true teacher will not
allow his school-room or the premises to be unkept,
unclean and unsanitary. The room and
premises will be in keeping with the teacher.
The question is this: if a teacher possesses every
element of a good teacher, but allows the school-room
and premises to be unkept and disorderly,
will it affect the character of the work? It will
to an extent. As was stated in the introduction
to this book, every factor in the child’s surroundings
has some influence. We simply can not
expect to encourage order and system in a child’s
school work if that child is in the atmosphere
of disorderly surroundings. Just as a well-cooked
meal would lose much of its appetizing
effect, and possibly even be rejected, if it were
served in an unclean place, so a teacher’s good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>influence may be lost to a considerable extent
through carelessness about details and lack of
proper attention to the general appearance of
the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The master of a school who found that the
boys misused the halls, scribbling on the walls,
throwing things around carelessly, breaking the
glass globes of the gas jets, and playing rough
games, changed the situation, not by making new
rules or devising new punishments, but by improving
the halls. He reformed the manners of
the boys by repainting the dingy corridors, hanging
them with attractive pictures, and improving
the general order. For order invites order,
and the perception that the school authorities
care for the comfort and the pleasure of the
children calls out a quick response.”<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>In the school-room, the spirit of work will be
enhanced by pleasant and orderly surroundings.
Orderliness in the arrangement of school equipment,
including definiteness of instruction given,
will beget order in the pupil’s work and habits.
It will go further; it will transplant itself to the
child’s home, where order will be established,
because the child’s life is being moulded in the
school-room. Whatever influence is at work to
better the homes in any way, is a most worthy
influence.</p>

<p class='c008'>However small the school-room may be, it is
the duty of every teacher to see first of all that
the room is clean, the seats and other furniture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>dusted and a few well-chosen pictures on the
wall. No teacher is so poor that he cannot afford
a few simple pictures for his school-room. Then
a vase of flowers on the desk and one in a window
will add charm. Much better would it be to
have several potted plants in the school-room.
They add freshness to the looks of the surroundings.
It has been suggested that pupils can
bring pictures from their homes, thereby saving
that expense for the teacher. The author believes
it is a poor teacher, indeed, financially and
in spirit, who can not afford several pictures for
his school-room. His pride would be at a low
ebb, and no doubt, it would be well for him to
read articles on the value of pictures. In this
connection it is worth while to consider the custom
of relegating that which does not appeal to
one. The children will bring from their home
such pictures as the home does not prize. Will
such pictures have an æsthetic value?</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c008'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sneath and Hodges, op. cit., p. 190.</p>
</div>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Relegated Pictures</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Neither should the teacher adorn the walls of
his school-room with pictures relegated from his
own home. Pictures in a school-room are a necessity.
Their presence means much. Where
the surroundings are not luxurious, the pictures
need not be expensive, but they should have
meaning. Where the school-room is modern
and the walls are well painted or papered, better
and more expensive pictures can be used. Large
showy frames should be avoided. Great care
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>should be exercised in the selection of pictures.
By no means, allow the common advertising
pictures or calendars to be hung in the room.
They are gaudy and have no place in a study of
art. A room in which the walls are decorated
with various advertising pictures and calendars,
indicates a teacher of poor taste. It would be
better to use no pictures at all than to use advertisements.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Effects of a Good Picture</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The author has often taken keen delight in
watching a pupil, who had been busily engaged
in study for half an hour, look up, and finally let
his eyes fasten upon some simple picture on the
school-room wall, and then go into a reflective
mood. Who can tell the worth of some fancy
being indulged, or some air-castle being built,
and besides the pupil was getting a rest by
change of occupation. No great achievement
has ever been attained, but that it was first a day-dream
or an air-castle.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Good Mottoes</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>How many men recall how they were inspired
to much greater ambition when as boys in the
school-room they looked upon the simple mottoes,
“Do Right,” “Never Give Up,” “He Succeeds
Who Tries,” etc.? The benign face of
Abraham Lincoln, of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,
of Francis E. Willard or some other celebrity
has carried many a pupil’s ambition to
higher levels. Pictures of the Christ Child, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Madonnas, of Nature scenes, and other standard
subjects are very appropriate for the school-room.
They will have their influence. Little
did the mother of three sons, who all became
sailors, think that a certain impressive picture of
the sea in her home would create love for the
sea in the bosoms of her offspring. It did. So
will many other beautiful pictures create a love
for the real which the picture idealizes.</p>

<p class='c008'>It must be borne in mind that while the surroundings
of the child are vital factors in his
educational progress, still the best teacher can,
to a certain degree, do good work in bad surroundings.
But the work will be far better in
clean, sanitary and orderly buildings and premises.
The opposite, likewise is true; the best
kept house and premises will not enable a poor
teacher to do good work. Good surroundings
will have a good effect and make the work easier.
A good teacher in poor surroundings can not be
conceived of as being satisfied.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>The Seating of Pupils</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>A few other details of the school should be
mentioned. It is important that the seating of
pupils be the best. Pupils should not be required
to sit in seats, either too small or too
large for them. Often teachers attempt to have
pupils sit by grades, frequently putting a large
pupil into a seat much too small, or the opposite,
just as bad, a small pupil into a seat much too
large. Teachers should not do this. To endanger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>a child’s health in order to have him sitting
with his grade is a crime. Put the pupil
in a seat that will suit him, irrespective of grade.
If no such seat is in the room, see to it at once
that one is provided. That may mean a visit to
the Board of Education. The teacher is the
guardian of the children and it is his duty to
ask the Board for proper seats for pupils, if such
have not been provided. Pupils should not be
compelled to sit so as to face a window or any
opening admitting light. The best lighting for
a school-room is from the left and back, but if
this is impossible, it should at least not be from
the front. Should any school-room be so constructed
as to have light from the front, shades
should be wisely used. Bright sunlight should
never be allowed to shine upon the pupils’ desks.
It is extremely hard on the eyes to study from a
page lighted by the direct rays of the sun.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Color Schemes</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps, no more thoughtless injury is done
the eyes of pupils than that caused by the choosing
of unwise color schemes for papering and
painting the wall of school-rooms. In short, to
make a school-room look cheerful, pink, yellow,
and often red are chosen as the colors that will
produce the desired effect. The motive is all
right, but the cheerfulness is far outweighed by
actual harm done the eyes of the pupils. Aside
from the bad effect of bright colors on the eyes,
there is a tendency to increase restlessness on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>part of the pupils by their use. Many nervous
pupils are irritated by striking surroundings. A
school-room in which colors and furnishings are
harmoniously blended so as to obtain soft contrasts,
always produces quiet and will have a
restful effect upon all pupils. No color is better
than a very soft green, with ceiling just tinged
with green. Nature for the greatest part of the
year has green in her color arrangement. It is
restful to the eyes. Again, taking a suggestion
from Nature, her grays are soft and free from
sharp contrasts. In papering or painting walls
gray, care must be exercised, not to select a gray
that is too dark; it will have a tendency to make
the school-room appear dreary. Another good
color is tan. Great care must be exercised in
using tan, since, in most cases it is too bright.
Blue is one of Nature’s colors, but as a rule blue
in any shade is not suitable for school-room
walls. The author is aware of the fact that
thousands of schools have white walls. This
should not be. Ten cents worth of green coloring
matter in the hands of a decorator will give
a suitable tint to a school-room interior.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Ventilation</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The matter of school-room ventilation is important.
In every school-room, even during the
coldest weather, some opening or openings
should admit fresh air. Children should not sit
where a direct draught blows upon them. Small
openings at the tops of the windows furnish a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>safe inlet for fresh air. It is a good plan to open
all the windows and doors of the school-room,
for at least half an hour, after school is dismissed
each day if no general ventilation system is installed.
This will avoid having impure air shut
in the school during the night, thereby permeating
every nook and crevice of the school-room
and even becoming offensive. Fresh air admitted
after dismissal will keep the school-room
pure and fresh and afford a place where the
pupils will feel invigorated upon entering the
next morning. Often, pupils come in from the
fresh air only to breathe the stifling air of the
school-room. Little wonder then that the teacher
must complain of dull pupils before the clock
points to ten. No foul air is likely to be found
in a school-room at the hour of opening if fresh
air is admitted each day after dismissal.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>The Basement</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Another very common source of foul odors in
the school-room is the basement. Though many
school-rooms do not have a basement, yet so
many have a problem at this point that it is necessary
to speak about the matter. The author
has visited many schools with basements, and
recalls one only that was actually sanitary. Most
basements of schools are the receptacles for the
garbage and refuse of the school. In it are kept
broken seats, old brooms, things forgotten and
left at school by pupils, waste paper, paint cans,
flower pots, and a hundred other things. To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>make matters worse, the basement windows, if
there are any, are never opened. A disease producer
is beneath the children; contagion gets
through the cracks of the floor and is a constant
source of contamination of the air in the room
above. Many basements are even abodes of rats
and mice, thereby exposing the pupils to different
diseases. Damp and rainy days increase the
offensiveness of an unsanitary basement. Unscrupulous
teachers often use the ill-ventilated
basement for a play room during bad weather.
Such a practice is abominable. No teacher
should be guilty of such an offense. Better not
let the pupils play at all, for exercise in offensive
air is dangerous and far worse than none. If
any place in the entire school should be sanitary,
it should be the basement.</p>

<p class='c008'>After all has been said about the equipment of
the school-room, the greatest asset is its sanitary
condition and cleanliness. This must be at its
best to secure good results. The unclean school-room—especially
the unventilated one, usually
a condition indicating a lazy, careless teacher—is
dangerous. Disease may lurk in such a place
and the mental activities of the pupils be stupefied.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>The Janitor</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Closely related to the teacher’s care of the
school-room is the work of the janitor. True,
many schools do not have any problem respecting
the janitor, yet a word about his relations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>with the teacher or supervisor is necessary. The
supervisor should see to it that the janitor is
thoroughly educated in the proper care of the
school and premises. If the janitor knows little
about such matters, as is usually the case, he
should be instructed in every detail. Here caution
is very needful. A teacher should never appear
to be authoritative to a janitor; he is the
school’s most necessary adjunct and should be
treated with every respect. When giving orders
always talk the matter over with him, asking
his opinion; when he gives his ideas, request
him to carry them out for the benefit of the
school. Never fail to inspect the work of the
janitor; that is, his regular work as well as that
which was specially assigned to him. If it does
not meet your approval, kindly suggest wherein
it may be improved. If the work is satisfactory,
never fail to tell the janitor, not in a formal
manner, but make him feel your sincerity and
appreciation of his efforts. To show him the
good results that will arise from his painstaking
labors, will heighten his desire to do his best.</p>

<p class='c008'>Often, although it is extremely poor policy,
the janitor is asked to aid actively in discipline;
this is not his province, as he is not appointed to
take charge of such matters. It is the teacher’s
duty to discipline his own pupils. The janitor
can often become a factor in discipline. Many
teachers treat him with such a domineering spirit
that they incur his ill will. When ill-treated the
janitor will gossip and sometimes he may say
something detrimental about the teacher to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>pupils. This has a tendency to weaken the
teacher’s influence and ability to control. A
janitor should be required to keep his clothing
neat and clean. He should not use offensive
language, nor should he smoke or use tobacco
in any form or become intoxicated. In fact, his
morals should be excellent. Allow the janitor
and his family to attend all school functions,
free of charge. Often the janitor desires a day
of half day off; do not deny him this privilege.
Whenever, unfortunately, an inefficient janitor
has been employed, he, as well as an unqualified
teacher, should be discharged.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Summary</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>1. It is important that any discussions of the
requisites of the teacher should be followed by
a discussion of the proper care of the school-room

<p class='c008'>2. The condition of the school-room and the
premises will have an influence upon the teacher
as well as upon the work done by the pupils.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. A good teacher, filling every requisite, will
see that the condition of the school-room and
premises has proper attention.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. A good teacher’s work will be made better

by bad surroundings.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. A poor teacher’s work will be improved by

<p class='c008'>6. The condition of the school-room and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>premises will have an influence on the condition

<p class='c008'>7. Every school-room should have good mottoes
and pictures on the walls. Some potted
plants should be in the room. Never put advertising
pictures and calendars on the walls.</p>

<p class='c008'>8. Waste paper, ash heaps and other rubbish
should not adorn the school premises. The latter
should be kept clean and orderly.</p>

<p class='c008'>9. Proper seating of pupils is necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>10. Light should be from the left and back,
never from the front. Direct sunlight should
never fall on pupils’ desks or books.</p>

<p class='c008'>11. The walls of the school-room should not
be tinted or papered with bright colors. Soft
green, gray and tan are suitable colors.</p>

<p class='c008'>12. School-room ventilation is very important.</p>

<p class='c008'>13. The basement of a school should be as

  <h2 class='c004'>PART THREE<br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Discipline: Its Province and End</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>What is discipline? It is the habit of
obedience. It is submissiveness to
order and control. It is subjection to
rule. It is a training to act in accordance
with established rules. Discipline obviously
must be control. Definition after definition
may be sought, all ultimately designating discipline
as control. Though it is known that discipline
is control or submissiveness to order and
system, still there remains much to be said to
clear up the idea of discipline. In examining
the province of discipline, many questions arise.
Does discipline guarantee that a teacher is able
to punish all offenses with the correct punishment,
and by so doing insure against the recurrence
of offense; or does it mean any given code
of rules that will prevent misdemeanors; or does
it mean the assigning of punishment for offenses
so as to display vengeance against the wrong
doer, suppressing him for the time being, but
instigating him to further wrong when the opportunity
offers itself? It means far more than
can be fully explained in any brief answer.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>The Province of Discipline</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Discipline is that vital control of an individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>that molds character. All those agencies
that are employed to perfect and round out character
are disciplinary devices.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The daily discipline of a good school is a
constant instruction in morals. The idea of
order that is suggested in the appearance of the
school is here perceived in action. There is a
regulated system into which the individual must
enter. He must subordinate his own desires and
impulses to the general social welfare. Thus
he learns the elementary virtue of obedience.
He takes orders and obeys them. He becomes
accustomed to an authority which he must respect.”<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Were every product of the school-room a perfectly
disciplined product, the pupil would be
self-controlling and the prophecy that perfect
discipline would annihilate prisons, reforms and
courts of justice would become a fact. A human
being self-controlled after experience under a
sound system of discipline would offer little
difficulty as a subject of school management.
Since discipline is a training in self-control and
self-direction, which are prime elements in character,
discipline is indispensable in character
building.</p>

<p class='c008'>Training in self-mastery is impossible without
a prearranged determination of conduct.
Some one must analyze the possible types of
activity and wisely direct the immature person
in choosing his standards of conduct.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>The End in Discipline</h3>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Assuming that the teacher understands the
great importance of discipline, it becomes necessary,
before discussing its underlying principles,
to consider some other phases of the subject.
First of all it is most important to understand
the end to be achieved in discipline. It is true
that all aimless discipline is poor discipline
whatever may be the teacher’s zeal. A clear
knowledge of the end to be attained is not only
important as a guide to methods of discipline,
but will fully predetermine the results. The
question now arises: “Just what is the end to be
sought in discipline?” Some one may say, “The
end to be sought in discipline is good order;”
some one else may say, “application.” It is
neither chiefly. These are mere conditions of
successful school work, and are not at all ultimate
ends to be attained through discipline. The
teacher who regards these as the ends of discipline
is not only likely to use improper means,
but will be satisfied with a mere semblance of
success. The true end of discipline is none other
than the achievement of self-control. This includes
an efficient moral training by: (1) the
awakening of proper sentiments, (2) quickening
of the conscience, (3) enlightening of moral
judgment, (4) training the will to act habitually
from high and worthy motives, (5) thoughtfulness
as to the rights of others and (6) a practical
religious training.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bagley discovers three chief functions of discipline:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>(1) the creation and preservation of
conditions that are essential to orderly progress
of the work for which the school exists; (2)
“The preparation of the pupils for effective participation
in an organized adult society;” (3)
“The gradual impression of the fundamental
lessons of self-control.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Discipline is, therefore, the last directive factor
of the educative process. It is to the soul
what logic or geometry is to the mind, or gymnastics
to the body: it aims at bracing the will.
But it has been seen that self-direction grows
out of external direction; self-discipline out of
the discipline of the home and the school. External
discipline is good only when it does lead
to the development of self-control.”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f10'>

</div>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>The Teacher as a Concrete Ideal</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>A clear vision of the end to be attained in discipline
presupposes that the teacher embody
every ideal of self-control that is needed to build
up the perfectly rounded-out character. The
teacher is the soul of his measures. The child is
a pilgrim, needing to be led; a growing entity,
needing to be nourished. Then it follows that
the teacher becomes the ideal—a living, growing,
real ideal for the pupil. This is not true
in a general and abstract way only, for in every
phase of his work, the teacher must by the very
nature of the process adapt himself—his
thought, his action, his feeling, <i>his life</i>—to what
the pupil is and should next become. Here it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>becomes apparent that the teacher is not a remote
or unattainable ideal, but a very near and
present help for every succeeding activity of the
pupil—a help-meet for good. The remote end
of discipline, self-control, is realized by a constant
presentation of the ideal embodied in the
teacher, by a vitalizing association with the
child. In this way the ideals of the teacher dominate
the life of the child.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a story extant that an eagle was
hatched with a brood of goslings. Unconscious
of its eagle nature, it kept to the earth with its
unnatural mates, until one day an eagle soaring
along, swooped down near it and touched it with
the spirit of the freedom of the upper air. It took
wing into the realms of its natural abode. The
child, beautiful in his simple life, needs but the
touch of that ideal embodied in a spirit that will
bring him into his rightful sphere. Many years
ago a venerable pastor, whose life was a fountain
of constant inspiration for good, returned to the
scenes of his boyhood and called upon the aged
pedagogue who had taught him in his youth.
He reported the good work he believed he had
accomplished. He told the teacher that he was
regarded as a bad boy in his school days, but that
the pedagogue had turned him into paths of
right, where-upon the old man asked, “What
was it I said?” The worthy pastor replied, “Ah,
it was not what you said; it was your life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The teacher’s life, his ideals, his habits will be
lived over again in those whom he teaches. Thus
it can be seen that it is not sufficient for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>teacher to set up imaginary ends and theories for
realizing them in pupils; he himself must be the
realized end. It is scarcely worth while for a
teacher to set up as an end in the pupils the
formation of correct habits and forms of thought
without realizing them in himself. It need
not be said that a teacher who can not think with
scientific patience and precision can not train
others to such patience and precision. Honesty
can be cultivated only by him who is honest.
Truth can be cultivated only by him who is
truth-loving. The love of work can be taught
only by him who works. Noble thinking can
be stimulated only by him who is imbued with
nobleness of thought. The idealized spirit of
faith and hope can shine forth only from the
soul that hopes and has the faith that radiated
from the spirit of the Teacher of Galilee. “In
another aspect discipline is a relation between
the child and the teacher, and here the contribution
of the teacher is his personality and the
force of his will, to which the child responds
with trust, obedience and the will to please.”<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Both Good and Bad Traits Are Copied</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>This introduces the distinction between conscious
and unconscious instruction. The teacher
by planned and immediate efforts, by definite
and formal instruction, draws the pupil into his
own more perfect thought and life; but much
of the influence exerted by the teacher is unconscious
and without forethought; effort and purpose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>would diminish it. Pupils are so susceptible
to the silent influence of the teacher that
they are supposed to make some permanent
change each time they come into the presence of
the teacher. There is a reason for this belief.
Experience and observation have taught that
personal contact works marvellously on the
young who are continually in the presence of
those whom they admire. Pupils instinctively
copy the teacher, even in the case of mannerisms.
Thrice fortunate is the teacher who possesses
a strong personality, if his life incarnates
all that is ideal and beautiful. Pupils assimilate
both the evil and the good. How expedient it
is then that they find only beautiful traits and a
wholesome spirit which, like a fragrance filling
the air, surrounds the noble-minded and warm-hearted
teacher. Not so much by the daily task
imposed and the instruction meted out as by the
silent worship of the heart, does the child flower
into beautiful life, and ripen into worthy manhood
or womanhood.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every teacher should be to the child a worthy
model. Thus, by admiration and worship directed
toward a superior, would the pupil realize
the worth and beauty of all the good in the
true teacher’s life. Using the wisest and most
precise method of instruction does not fill the
measure of the teacher’s responsibility. After
all the pupil is circumscribed and continues to
walk on earth among common things, unless
quickened by a touch from the hovering spirit
in the higher life of a teacher.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>In a former chapter it has been pointed out
that the school, as a home for the child during
his school career, definitely molds character.
Also, the teacher’s intellectual qualifications
have been fully set forth. But meeting these requirements
alone cannot insure success for
the teacher. In this chapter the moral influence
of the teacher has been clearly explained as an
agency in the character building of the child.
Discipline has been interpreted as a training in
self-control, and self-control as a prime element
in character. Then it must be evident that <i>discipline
is the teacher’s one great function</i>. When
the teacher has directed his every effort and
energy toward discipline, he is doing his utmost
to build permanent, worthy character, providing
that he possesses every attribute of the true
teacher and uses those underlying principles of
discipline, that alone can make <i>true discipline</i>
possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In childhood the trainer makes the child;
during adolescence the youth makes himself. In
childhood habits are forged by the unreasoned
processes of reiteration; during youth they are
made by voluntary acceptance of an inner ideal
and the conscious nurture of that ideal. For the
child habit-making should be as unconscious as
breathing; for the youth it should be his deliberate
and high-born duty. A wise teacher will
never talk habits to children; before they know
it, he will have them chained—no, that is a
hateful and vicious figure—he will have them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>free as the wings of a bird in the unconscious
and happy regulations of their lives.”<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c004'>PART FOUR<br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Fundamental Principles in Discipline</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Before entering into the discussion of the
fundamental principles underlying discipline,
it will be well to explode the erroneous
notion that too many teachers
hold: namely, that general principles of discipline
are not broadly applicable. To illustrate,
recently a certain magazine made the announcement
that a notable educator was writing a
course in child training. To this, one of those
all-wise pessimists replied that the educator
would have to write just as many courses as
there were children, assuming that each child is
a totally different entity and what can be used in
the training of one child cannot possibly be employed
in the education of another. Such an assumption
is unsound, unfounded and absurd. In
the following pages the writer proposes to prove
the fallacy of such a notion.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Various Dispositions</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Again and again it may be heard that should a
school have twenty-five pupils, there would be
twenty-five different dispositions to handle and
that what might be used in disciplining one child
could not be used in disciplining another. No
one wishes to gainsay that there are as many different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>dispositions as there are individuals, but
these different dispositions will all undoubtedly
respond to the great fundamental laws underlying
discipline. To attempt to deny the operation
and general effectiveness of fundamental
principles in discipline would be an attempt
to overthrow a bulwark of accumulated evidence
of the past. Principles that are fundamental, not
alone in discipline, but in every activity, have
operated in unmistakable surety since the dawn
of history. To deny this would only tend to
weaken one’s faith in principles that when
properly applied have always overcome the
most stubborn problems in discipline.</p>

<p class='c008'>Small minds often find it impossible to collect
useful knowledge into general statements. They
prefer to settle each difficulty by reference to a
similar former experience. On the other hand
one who profits largely from his experience is
able finally to draw broad conclusions which he
can use in widely different situations.</p>

<p class='c008'>This power of generalization makes easy the
comparison of experiences of teachers and so
skill in disciplinary matters multiplies itself at
every opportunity for the exchange of ideas.</p>

<p class='c008'>A number of careful observations made in the
school-room will sustain the assertion that any
fundamental principle will certainly become applicable
to the mass of individuals. It is a universal
law that a fundamental principle of
psychological import works toward the same
end in every normal individual. Several years
ago a principal in a large high school made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the following observations. One of his teachers
was keenly sensitive to all the little faults of the
pupils. Seven of the boys and five of the girls
had been reported by her to the principal for
various offenses. Each of the twelve pupils portrayed
entirely different characteristics. Their
offenses too were entirely different as well as
their motives. Here was a plain case of twelve
different dispositions, which no one would attempt
to ignore, but quite naturally, the teacher
did not use twelve different methods of procedure;
she had a feeling of distrust toward all
of these pupils. She did not openly show it, but
before the school closed there was an open rupture
between those pupils and the teacher—they
hated her—why? They could hardly tell. It
was due to her attitude of distrust. This evil was
not openly at work (except to a keen observer)
but silently, it operated upon twelve different
dispositions in the same way—all to one end.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the same school and at the same time,
labored another teacher who reported the same
boys and girls, but her reports were followed up
by a deep love toward and helpful trust in those
boys and girls. She did not tell them that she
trusted and loved them. The principle accomplished
its mission silently—as is always the
case. These boys and girls, without knowing
why, came to love, respect and obey this teacher.
She did not use different methods on the different
dispositions, but in silence a fundamental
principle at work, won for her the admiration of
all her pupils. She was a successful disciplinarian.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>She skillfully applied fundamental principles,
and it is needless to add that no serious
outbreaks against discipline ever occurred under
her management. It is all too true that the failure
to understand fundamental principles in discipline
is the certain cause of perplexing problems
that will suggest “so-called” different
methods for different dispositions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Broad underlying principles in discipline are
safe and the teacher who would seek skill in
school management will ground himself in these
broad underlying principles—principles that
have been effective through countless decades of
successful school management. It is an axiom
that the teacher who fails to use the fundamental
principles of confidence will have many examples
of distrust. The teacher who persists in
fault finding will always have sufficient material
upon which to exercise his fault finding impulse.
The teacher who is constantly expecting trouble
will soon be rewarded; while on the other hand,
the teacher who has an abiding faith in his pupils
and himself does not expect real antagonism—true
to the universal law, never meets an insoluble
problem in school-room discipline. The
teacher who displays a deep interest in his work
and an interest in the work and welfare of his
pupils, will have an industrious school; he will
not need to lecture to his pupils about the necessity
of diligence; they will show their zeal by
doing the work assigned. It is “catching” from
the teacher who has an interest and works upon
the principle that it is necessary for a teacher,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span><i>first</i>, to enjoy doing school work well before the
pupils can be expected to do likewise. No one
denies that trust will beget trust, confidence will
beget confidence, good-will will beget good-will
and affection will beget affection. The opposite
is likewise true, hate will beget hate, distrust
will beget distrust, suspicion will beget suspicion,
and fault finding will beget dissatisfaction.
From the foregoing, it may be assumed
that the most skeptical must be convinced concerning
the broad and effective application of
general principles. In this connection, it is well
to remember, that fundamental principles can
not apply themselves, the teacher is the agent
that must apply the principles and adjust the
laws to every given case.</p>

<p class='c011'>The principle of suggestion will be given the
first consideration, not because it is more important
than any of the fundamental principle in
discipline, but because it is so obviously and
vitally correlated with all others. At the very
outset it is a truth that cannot be overlooked that
the teacher’s very life is a silent suggestive stimulus.
In fact all the other principles would lose
their effectiveness to a great extent were not the
principle of suggestion interwoven in their operations.
For example, the teacher has occasion
to use the principle of approval. In it the principle
of suggestion is involved. The teacher approves
of a pupil’s behavior, immediately there
is suggested to the pupil the idea of future good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>behavior for the sake of approval, and furthermore
because it means better class-standing.
The operation of the principle can even effect
other than direct results. A pupil or a number
of pupils, who were indifferent regarding this
special point of good behavior, indeed, who may
have been misbehaving at the time the other pupil
was conducting himself so as to elicit approval
from his teacher, will be affected by the
approval. The principle of suggestion leads
them to infer that they too can gain approbation
for good behavior. Thus, the principle operates
in channels where the teacher may not have directly
applied the principle.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principle of suggestion can be defined or
explained as the process by which associated
ideas follow one another into consciousness.
Sometimes it is explained simply as the association
of ideas. It can be termed an intrusion into
the mind of an idea; met with more or less
opposition by the person; accepted uncritically
at last; and realized unreflectively, almost automatically.
Suggestion is always a stimulus to
action. The proposed action may be external
or internal, a movement or an attitude. A suggestion
can never refer to a mere idea. If a
mere notion is aroused in the mind it is not
suggestion; it becomes such if an impulse to act
is aroused. This impulse may be suppressed or
it may ripen into action. One idea in the mind
or consciousness recalls another and so on, a
chain of ideas may pass through consciousness,
one suggesting the other. Quite often the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>idea is very unlike the first in content, and yet
if the suggestion is strong action results. “A
supply of ideas of the various movements that
are possible, left in the memory by experiences
of their involuntary performance, is thus the
first prerequisite of the voluntary life.”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Henry R. Pattengill, the great Michigan educator
and editor, recalls that when a small boy
in his log-cabin forest home, his father brought
an ax into the house one cold winter morning.
As the father laid the ax on the floor beside the
fireplace, he said to the children, “Don’t touch
that ax or your fingers will stick fast.” Then he
left the room. He had unconsciously applied
the principle of suggestion. No sooner was the
door closed than Henry revolved this question
in his mind, “Why will my fingers stick to the
ax?” This suggested that he try for himself and
see. The trial was made and the results were as
the father had intimated, but the boy did not
learn the true reason until years afterward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another illustration is in point. One of the
best rural schools in a Western State had employed
a new teacher. He was one of that class
of teachers who believe that rules were necessary
to cover every known misdemeanor that might
happen during the school-year. After opening
his school on the first day, he read his list of
rules. The pupils had always been well-behaved
and well-governed, but not unlike other children
were buoyant with abundant life. Among
his many rules was one that forbade any pupil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>to climb upon the woodhouse roof. The punishment
for disobeying the rule was a whipping.
He skillfully, but in the wrong place, applied
the principle of suggestion. Many of the pupils
had attended the school for six years and had
never thought of climbing upon the woodhouse
roof. The new teacher had given the suggestion.
Great was his surprise when he walked into
the back yard at recess and found every boy
and several of the bolder girls on the woodshed
roof. They had acted in accordance with the
principle of suggestion and it was “up to him”
to make good. His predestined punishment
was next in order to meet this result of a never-failing
operation of a fundamental principle.
The most lamentable part of the affair was that
the whipping was an impossibility with so large
a number of pupils. The teacher was compelled
to break one of his rules, which true to a fundamental
principle was a suggestion to his pupils
that he would break the others as well. It is
needless to say that his discipline was of the
poorest kind. He failed.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Rules</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>How many young teachers feel that it is very
necessary to have a code of rules! They make
themselves believe that it will display authority
to begin their first school by reading a list of
rules. No worse mistake could be made. By
reading a list of rules they are showing a distrust
in the boys and girls and thereby laying a
foundation for future trouble. It is better to say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>nothing about order on the first day of school
than to parade authority by setting forth rules.
Authority and firmness can be far better indicated
by beginning earnest work at once on the
first day without any reference to rules. “Authority
may compel because of its might, and often
it must compel because of its responsibility;
but the type of order that is most effective is that
in which the fact of coercion is least in evidence.
In the city and state, as in the school, the condition
that is sought is a “fashion” of obeying the
law and respecting the rights of others; and
while the forces that can coerce must be made
plainly evident to those who can be appealed to
in no other way, the wise executive keeps them
from constantly and irritatingly impinging upon
public attention.”<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Do not emphasize the idea of authority in the
pupils’ minds and your authority will not be
forever put to the test. It is a wrong use of the
principle of suggestion to exercise authority in
a way that is still far too common among teachers.
The average boy with good red blood in
his veins tends to take the attitude of authority
on the part of a teacher as a kind of challenge.
The teacher who is constantly flaunting his authority
will most assuredly have occasion to use
it. The less authority shown the less need for it,
is a safe rule to follow. It is bad policy to make
rules for the government of a school, and then
attach punishments of various kinds and degrees
for the infringement of the rules. In governing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>a school, it is time enough to deal with a misdemeanor
after it is committed. Often a certain
rule against a certain misdemeanor encourages
that act, thus operating in accordance with the
principle of suggestion. To apply unvarying
rules to varying conditions is a prolific source of
error and confusion. No rule can be made to
fit a case before it arises.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suggestion is certainly nothing abnormal and
exceptional. It does not lead us away from our
ordinary life. Child life is a rich field into
which suggestion may enter in a hundred different
forms. The life of the family, education,
law, business, politics, art, public life and religion
are all dependent upon suggestion.
Everywhere, at all times individuals are stimulated
to actions by outside suggestion, that they
would not perform, if they were to act upon
their own impulses or reasons. Experience
shows that different individuals have different
degrees of suggestive power. Attendant circumstances
have a great influence upon the power of
suggestion. Individual characteristics differ
widely as to the effect of suggestion.</p>

<p class='c008'>In no field of activity is the principle of suggestion
so powerful and useful as in the teachers
profession. It will be well to deviate from
the subject of suggestion to note that imitation
plays a vital part in suggestion in the school-room.
It must be remembered that imitation
follows suggestion; it is a resultant of suggestion.
The teacher who embodies every qualification
that makes a true teacher will suggest the traits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>of his character to his pupils. They will as a
natural sequence imitate them. Every trait of
a noble character is important and deserves to
be emulated by the child; the characteristics
that make successful men and women in every
activity of life are worthy of imitation. The
greatest trait of character is morality, and it is
the most vital of the teacher’s requisites. To
the average pupil this trait in the teacher’s character
will appeal. If the pupil’s moral life is
near perfection, the teacher’s life will only aid
in helping the pupil to maintain his standard.
This may be termed an unconscious co-operation
of the teacher with his pupil. Building a strong
character is not an easy matter for the average
pupil. He sees in his teacher those requisites
which he wishes to incorporate in his own life;
he must overcome his own weakness; when he
does so, he is allowing the teacher’s worthy characteristics
to suggest to his the possibility of incarnating
them into his own life. This is neither
co-operation or imitation merely, but suggestion.
It is also true of the law of suggestion that if the
teacher exhibits unworthy traits of character,
these too will act as suggestions to the pupils.
It need not be argued further that the teacher’s
life is a powerful incentive to imitation through
suggestion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suggestion as an agency for effective volition
does not stop with those elements that build
character. It reaches into the child’s life at
every opening. His habits of work, of study, of
play, and every physical, mental and spiritual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>process are largely influenced by the principle of
suggestion. In fact, his first notions always come
from some suggestion. His first ideas of play,
of work, and of study come as ideas from some
one else or from some outside source. The notion
in itself, at first, is abstract, but becomes concrete
and a part of the child when he allows
the suggestion of the notion to cause him to act
so as to make the notion a reality and a part of
his life.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the most powerful agencies for suggestion
is the school community itself. The
principal of a school had the pleasure of transferring
his pupils to a new building, erected at
a cost of more than sixty thousand dollars. He
resolutely set his mind to the task of preserving
the property from defacement.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the old building a succession of teachers
and pupils had allowed to grow up the custom
of grossly injuring both the structure proper
and the equipment as well. Both in public and
in private he judiciously drew the picture of
the contrast between the appearances of the two
buildings. At the proper moment on each occasion
he asked the individual or the school as
a whole, as the case might be, if the preservation
of the new building in its perfect condition was
desirable: “Do you want to keep the new school
house fresh and in perfect order as long as possible?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The pupils in a large majority, of course, declared
that that was their desire. The public
sentiment soon became so strong that it entirely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>suppressed the few who otherwise would have
continued the policy of defacing school property.
There arose a community will among the pupils
that made itself felt and held in easy control the
unruly members of the school.</p>

<p class='c008'>The teacher who fails to make use of this
agency for suggesting courses of action to his
pupils is neglecting a powerful force in the
management of his school. Suggestions are rapidly
transferred from pupil to pupil; a proper
choice of the occasion is necessary; a careful
balancing of diverse elements in the school
group must be achieved; a variety of appeals
to meet differences in dispositions is required;
a knowledge of these guiding facts can not but
make the plan of community suggestion a feasible
and in fact a necessary instrument in school
management.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The best disciplined school that the writer
has ever seen was under the charge of a principal
who had worked for six years to make the
collective will of the pupil-body give its sanctions
to good order, courteous behavior, and aggressive
effort. Interest in school work and co-operation
with the teachers had become distinct
fashions. So powerful was the force thus generated
and directed that the superintendent not
infrequently transferred to this school pupils
who had got beyond control in other schools of
the city.”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Since suggestion is by nature a stimulus to
action it may be well to urge that all attempts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>to use suggestion as a disciplinary measure
should be moulded by some specific plan of
action for the pupil.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the teacher attempts to direct merely the
attitudes or feelings of the pupil he will often
fail in the use of suggestion. Every person
whether child or adult has far more interest in
activity than in inaction. Even rest is always
considered a preparation for further activity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Activity may be of two kinds: work and play.
Suggestion may be used in both. Madame
Montessori says: “The first dawning of real discipline
comes through work.”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a> The fascination
of a piece of work even in the kindergarten will
fix attention, inspire persistence and in countless
ways actually direct the impulses of the child.
Discipline through work is the most ready and
appropriate agency for the moral training of
all, both young and old.</p>

<p class='c008'>The teacher who understands the disciplinary
resources of the school tasks is a competent
teacher and disciplinarian. The more completely
the discipline of the school is fused with the established
school program of activity the better
will be the results reached.</p>

<p class='c008'>Play is a part of the recognized outline of
school functions. It is second only to work as
an educative instrument. All that may be said
of the wise use of suggestion in work may be
repeated with slight modifications in respect to
play. The teacher must give as much wise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>thought to the suggestive features of play as to
any other element in school life.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>The Principle of Leading Suggestion</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Some years ago a young country teacher called
upon one of his city friends late one winter
afternoon. Just as the teacher was leaving his
friend’s home, the conversation turned to a topic
that was very interesting to both, but the teacher
had three miles to walk into the country and
knew that he could not tarry to finish the conversation.
However, he asked his friend to walk
with him from the house to the first telephone
post so that they might carry on their conversation.
The friend knew that supper would be
ready in a few minutes but the suggestion to walk
so small a distance from his home in order to
carry on an interesting conversation was appealing
and he yielded to the teacher’s wish. Upon
reaching the telephone post the conversation had
grown more interesting instead of reaching an
end, so the teacher suggested that his friend
walk two blocks further with him to a certain
school building. The friend acted upon the
suggestion, but upon reaching the school building
the conversation had reached a greater point
of interest and was in no way near completion.
Both were deeply interested. The teacher made
the suggestion that his friend walk to a certain
bridge with him. Again the friend acted upon
the suggestion. So, on they journeyed until the
friend discovered that he had walked half of the
way from his home to the teacher’s home, besides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>forgetting all about his supper. No one
will doubt that had the teacher asked his friend
to walk half way to his home with him just as
they left the house, he would not have succeeded
in inducing him to do so, even by the use of
most persistent persuasion. But he succeeded
in taking his friend with him by suggesting a
little part of the journey at a time. He had used
a principle that for the want of a better name
will be called the Principle of Leading Suggestion.</p>

<p class='c008'>However, it is not a matter of the name of the
principle, but the principle itself and its application
that interests the teacher. How many
teachers have failed to lead pupils to do what
they have asked them to do, all because the imposed
task appeared to be too hard. This same
task could have been readily accomplished had
the teacher divided it into inviting portions and
requested the pupil to do just one part at a time.
In this case the whole task should not be discussed
at first. At no time in the journey described
above did the friend think but that the small
distance suggested would be the last part of the
journey and at the end of it he would turn homeward.</p>

<p class='c008'>The teacher discovers among his pupils a boy
who dislikes to read. The teacher knows the
boy’s likes and dislikes and is sure that certain
books would interest him, but to ask the boy to
read an entire book would only mean to further
discourage him as to the reading habit. Hence,
the teacher asks the boy to read the first chapter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>on a certain day for a specific purpose which he
frankly makes known to the boy. A few days
may elapse before the teacher asks the boy to
read the second chapter with some other aim in
view, perhaps. Thus the teacher labors until
the boy has read the book. In most cases the
boy will announce that he read on ahead of the
teacher’s assignment and will ask for another
book “just like this one.” He has broken the
ice and by a wise choice of books on the part of
the teacher, he may become an enthusiastic
reader.</p>

<p class='c008'>The teacher with a keen insight will see no
limit to the number of results that may be obtained
by the use of leading suggestion. In the
primary grades it can be made a very effective
tool for advancing the child’s interests. The
stubborn and willful child will respond readily
to this principle and may thus be cured of his
habit of obstinacy. This principle can be applied
to advance the interests of children as well as to
cure traits of disposition that are not desirable.
The teacher who wishes to accomplish results
along these lines will carefully study the dispositions
of pupils; and further, watch for every advantage
whereby he may tactfully apply the
principle of leading suggestion for the furtherance
of effective work.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Imitation</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Reference has been made to imitation as being
closely connected with suggestion. Its further
discussion is in place here. Aristotle said, “Man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>is the most imitative of animals, and makes his
first steps in learning by the aid of imitation.”
The thought has a broader application. The
first steps in all of the child’s activities are made
because of imitation. The first phase in the
gaining of power and facility in action is imitation
of the action of another. It is highly important
for the teacher to remember, in attempting
to direct boys and girls, that all are imitators
of those whom they admire. Men have been
described as the composite of all those who have
directly or indirectly made some impress upon
their lives. Too great care cannot be exercised
as to the kind of associations and friendships
pupils make, as each contact will leave its effect
upon them for good or for evil. The teacher is
the most important associate and friend of many,
many pupils; consequently, it is of the utmost
importance that his life conform to the best
standards of character. Imitation is an inborn
disposition which is not learned but precedes
learning. In fact, it is a means employed in
learning. By using both imitation and suggestion
properly, the teacher will have a device
that will go a great way toward his success in
discipline.</p>

<p class='c008'>In another volume entitled “Applied Methods,”
a book which gives the practical applications
of our fundamental principles—the principle
of suggestion will be applied to various
school-room difficulties. The application will
be made in such a manner that the teacher can
easily understand its use to best advantage in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>own problems of discipline. All other fundamental
principles discussed will be shown in
their practical applications. This will leave no
doubt in the teacher’s mind as to the use of fundamental
principles in school-room problems.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>The Principle of Approval</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The next principle under consideration is the
principle of approval. The desire for approval
appears early in childhood, and continues
through life. It acts both as a restraint and as an
impulse, and is often an active principle in
human conduct. No true child is insensible to
the good opinions of his classmates or to the commendation
of his teacher. It has been wisely
said, “A young man is not far from ruin when
he can say with honesty, ‘I don’t care what others
think about me.’” He has lost a needed check
against evil and a beneficent impulse toward
right action.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just how far the application of the principle of
approval may justly extend in school-room discipline,
does not occur to the average teacher.
It is very safe to assume that the principle of
approval rightly used would be an effective preventative
of three-fourths of the perplexities that
harass the teacher in the school-room. The
usual process of dealing with a fault, is to aggravate
it by constant reference to it. This is
wrong. But the teacher replies, “How can a
fault be removed except the child be constantly
reminded of its existence, and also reminded
of the corrective?” The teacher, too, may add
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>that reminding the pupil of his fault is not disapproval,
unless it be done in a fault finding
manner. That may all be very true. But the
principle of approval can affect the cure. The
following incident well illustrates the point.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some years ago there lived in one of the coast
towns of Maine, a big-hearted seaman, who was
considerably worried about his only son’s stoop
shoulders. In the kindliest manner possible, he
had reminded his son almost daily, that he
should throw back his shoulders. The son
understood his father’s kindness and interest in
the matter and at no time felt that his father was
finding fault with him. However, the boy continued
to be stoop shouldered. An uncle happened
into the house one day for a visit of several
weeks. The uncle was soon annoyed by the
constancy and utter uselessness of the father’s
corrective for his son’s stoop shoulders. The
uncle called the father aside and asked him if
he would not allow him to make an attempt at
correcting the boy’s stoop shoulders. The father
gladly agreed and also consented to have nothing
whatever to do with the affair. He felt that he
had done all he could and was unable to guess
what method the uncle would pursue. The
uncle very shrewdly saw a condition of the lad
that he might approve and thereby he would be
able to correct the stoop shoulders. The lad
knew nothing of his uncle’s plan and for that
reason responded the more readily, all unconscious
of the process at work. On the following
morning the father was amused to see the uncle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>give his son a jovial slap on the chest, and hear
him remark, “Say, Tom, that is some chest.”
No more was observed by the father for that day.
But the day following, the uncle again slapped
the boy on the chest, remarking, “I believe you
will have a broader and fuller chest than I
have;” at the same time displaying his chest well
filled out. Casual remarks of this kind were
dropped at opportune times. Tom’s chest expanded
until the stoop shoulders disappeared.
The cure was effective. The boy did not realize
that a double effect would follow his breathing
properly. Approval won where disapproval
failed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many a teacher has ruined the best of his pupils
by constantly finding fault with, or disapproving
of their small faults and inabilities;
while on the other hand many a prudent teacher
has made a good pupil out of one who promised
to be but a dullard by commending those small
things which he could do, and entirely overlooking
the things that he was unable to do. If attention
was called to what he could not do well,
it was only to offer some friendly assistance. It
is a fact that must not be forgotten that any
activity is made easier by its constant repetition.
Thus, if the small things that the pupil can do
are approved he naturally will work the harder
and thereby gain strength, until he has become
a master of himself accomplishing the most difficult
tasks.</p>

<p class='c008'>This principle is broadly applicable to all
school-work. There is no child that cannot do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>something in every phase of school-work. This
“something” the teacher should approve. It
will without fail stimulate the child to the fullest
use of his ability. The teacher should not ignore
that which the child fails to accomplish;
the task is often too difficult. Only such work
should be assigned as can be done, and the necessary
assistance should be given; by no means
should disapproval be meted out. This plan
followed conscientiously will improve the most
backward child. The question may be asked,
“What about the pupil who is indifferent or
neglects to complete his work?” It is well to approve
that which he <i>does</i>. If the teacher is sure
the pupil is indifferent or negligent, the child
should be told the truth about his work and have
his attention called to his ability to do better
work. To approve wisely and effectively does
not mean to deceive.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the matter of school-room discipline, the
principle of approval is even more valuable than
in school-room instruction. Everyone believes
that no boy or girl is so depraved that some good
traits can not be found. At some time they will
manifest their kindlier natures and do those
things which should elicit approval. Whenever
such pupils do anything worth while it gives the
teacher opportunity to use the word or look of
approval. This will encourage them to repeat
whatever elicits approval. It will increase the
frequency of such acts and create a desire to do
other things that are worth while. It is a time-honored
saying that if all one’s time is taken up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>in doing good deeds, there will be no time left
for evil deeds. This is no vague notion as to the
child’s life. Whatever increases the time spent
in doing things worth while will decrease the
time left for worthlessness and idleness.</p>

<p class='c008'>But what shall be done with those actions of
the pupils that are annoying? They cannot be
approved. Should they be disapproved? Yes.
But with caution. Should the teacher find fault
with the pupil on account of his misdemeanors?
No, decidedly no. It is the province of the
teacher to assist the children under his tuition.
Their faults and misdemeanors should not be
tools in the teacher’s hands to be used against
them. Such a procedure would be a crime.
Then how shall their faults and misdemeanors
be treated?</p>

<p class='c008'>The teacher who will succeed, will call the
pupil who has annoyed him aside and in a business-like
manner discuss the misdemeanor with
the pupil. The teacher must not accuse the pupil
but ask him for information; if the teacher
has met his pupil in a kindly way, he will get the
desired information; the teacher should admit
anything in which he may have been at fault and
then ask the pupil to admit his own fault. At
this point the teacher should never express his
opinion about the misdemeanor, before he has
asked the pupil to give his own opinion about the
action in controversy. With few exceptions the
pupil will express himself correctly about the
misdemeanor. The shrewd teacher will then
agree with his pupil, and in an offhand way add
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>any variance of opinion or give suggestions. If
this method is followed by a teacher in a kindly
but firm mood, the difficulty will have been
dealt with in the correct manner. The fault
will doubtless not be repeated by the pupil. And
without fail the teacher will have another firm
and true friend in this child.</p>

<p class='c008'>While much importance is attached to the
teacher’s correct use of the principle of approval,
still more is demanded of him. The value of
approval clearly depends upon its source—on
the character of him who approves. The approval
of the wicked or unscrupulous teacher is
a snare. The approval of the wise and good
teacher can never be valued too highly. A
teacher must watch lest his pupils put approval
before honor and duty. The motive which the
teacher must seek to cultivate, is not a craving
for unmerited praise and flattery, but a desire
to merit approval; and, this involves no surrender
of conscience or honor. This is a worthy
motive, but it must be remembered that it can
easily be submerged under pride and vanity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The degree of satisfaction to the child resulting
from approval depends upon his esteem for
those who bestow it. The satisfaction that comes
from approval of one’s equals, as classmates, is
less than that which comes from one’s superiors,
as parents or teachers. What has been said is
sufficient to show that the teacher needs to be
very careful in the use of approval as a disciplinary
device. The one thing to be avoided is
false praise or flattery. No weakness in the pupil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>is more easily aroused, or with more difficulty
suppressed than vanity. The desire for praise,
and especially public praise, grows on its own
gratification; the more the child gets the more he
wants. It is a good rule to speak ten words of
commendation to one of censure; but the commendation
should be sincere and honest and the
censure kind and just. Finally, it may be concluded
that whatever of good may come from
the use of the principle of approval in discipline,
depends in a large measure upon the teacher.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Encouragement</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Broadly speaking, encouragement is involved
in the principle of approval. Some years ago a
young man (Mr. X) of marked ability but of
such a temperament that he was easily discouraged,
was prevented from teaching school by
some crafty scheme of the county superintendent
and others who were opposed to the young man.
Mr. X was thoroughly prepared to teach and far
worthier in character than the county superintendent
and his accomplices. A friend of the
applicant, chancing to be with him one evening
in August just at sunset, took occasion in view
of the beautiful sunset to tell the young man how
much beauty there is in life. He explained that
adversities, such as he had just experienced are
only stepping stones to nobler efforts. He told
him not to heed the discouragement, but go right
on in his chosen work and success would crown
his efforts; and that after all, life was so full of
beauty that it would overshadow all difficulties.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>The young man and his friend parted. The
friend had forgotten Mr. X and did not know of
his whereabouts until one day a letter came to
him from the young fellow. The following
extract from the letter will explain how encouraging
was the talk of a few years before. “I
now have a good position in this city (the city
was Akron, Ohio) and can also teach if I care
to. I have often been discouraged, but remembered
your talk and resolved upon this sentiment
for myself: ‘There are two ways in life and if
young men and women would consider these
ways soberly and earnestly before moving onward
they would choose the one which truth and
reason tell them will lead to honor, success and
happiness.’ You and I know the other way too
well to need description. Life is not mean; it is
grand. If it is mean to anyone he makes it so
himself. God made it glorious. How much
life means to every individual, words cannot
explain. I have often been discouraged but I
looked upon the bright side and went on.”
There could be no more eloquent appeal for encouragement
as a device in the hands of the
serious teacher. Many are the times and opportunities
when a teacher can speak an encouraging
word and thereby send a life into a fuller
realization of its worth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes the best pupil in the school meets
with adversities (and they will come to every
individual ofttimes in life); they would overwhelm
him were it not for an encouraging word
from a thoughtful teacher. Every teacher
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>should keenly realize that it is a part of his
work, his actual <i>duty</i> to lend encouragement to
his pupils. If the lessons are hard, the teacher
must encourage; if the pupil has fallen into one
or more of the petty temptations that beset children
on every side, the teacher must forgive and
forget, and point out corrective measures, thereby
reassuring him and if the pupil has failed
the teacher must comfort him. It was Lowell
who said, “Not failure, but low aim, is crime.”
Every teacher can be a source of great good if
he will wisely help and encourage where encouragement
is needed. Such a teacher’s work
will live long after he is gone, and he will be
kindly remembered by many who are treading
life’s pathways.</p>

<p class='c008'>A few years ago a young man sought to enter
Columbia University for his last year of college
work, and discovered that he was quite deficient
in language requirements. Just as he was about
to leave the college and give up the fond hope
of completing his education, he was accosted
by a fraternity man, who was a stranger, but who
soon made himself a friend and so encouraged
and inspired the young student that he took
double work and succeeded in finishing his college
education. That young student is now a
man occupying a useful and worthy place of
trust in a large institution. The teacher who
can encourage a pupil as the fraternity man reassured
the young student, will have no trouble
in discipline with that pupil. The pupil who
has been saved from despair always has a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>warmth of feeling for the one who thus inspired
him.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>The Principle of Initiative in Co-operation</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Speaking of the child, Arthur Holmes<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a> says,
“He is organic, living, developing. He cannot
be kneaded like dough, nor hammered like iron,
nor carved like marble, but he can be guided like
a vine upon a trelis.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This work of directing the life of a child is
specially represented by some act which brings
satisfaction to the pupil and so begins an interplay
of personal forces that leads the pupil to
have confidence in the teacher.</p>

<p class='c008'>To mark off this kind of action we choose to
name the principle involved in it, the Principle
of Initiative in Co-operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Experience shows that no person can have the
desired educative influence over a child unless
it be by doing deeds that draw forth the child’s
appreciation. The turn of affairs in the school
depends on the teacher. He must choose and
choose wisely if his control over the pupils is
adequate. He must take the initiative in establishing
good relations and in maintaining
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the discussion following, the term co-operation
is used, but it is to be understood that
the teacher thoughtfully takes the first step in
all acts of co-operation, anticipating, of course,
the pupils’ reactions to all of his acts of service.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is no greater principle in discipline
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>than that of co-operation. No other one is more
potent among the teacher’s devices. But it is a
fact, much to be regretted, that no principle is
used less in the school-room. The fact is that a
majority of teachers do not realize what disciplinary
co-operation means. Its skillfull use
as an instrument of government is unknown to
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The inquiring teacher asks for an explanation
of the principle of co-operation. It means a
gratifying or yielding to a child’s wishes or
desires. Or, it is a forbearance from restraint
or control. It may be gratitude for a favor
granted; no doubt some teachers need to “Learn
the luxury of doing good.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Leniency and tolerance are forms of co-operation.
The term certainly denotes companionship
in performing every school duty.</p>

<p class='c008'>Co-operation requires mutual understanding
and sympathy. Clearly demonstrated by Pestalozzi,
this fundamental method of child management
has found recent advocates in the founders
of the Gary and Fairhope systems of instruction.</p>

<p class='c008'>The question comes up at once, “Will not
deviation from a uniform firmness which is implied
in co-operation weaken discipline?” Upon
close examination the opposite will be found to
be true. It has been explained that the real end
of discipline is self-control on the part of the
child and further that self-control is the basal
element in character.</p>

<p class='c008'>Co-operation demands that we understand the
nature of the child and enjoy giving him freedom,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>at the same time working with him, not
over him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The home or the school which manages children
by the use of authority chiefly is not working
toward the true object of discipline, but
away from it. The child who is constantly governed,
who has all his decisions formed by some
one else, has all his motives influenced by a parent
or teacher, in fact, his every activity controlled
by another mind, will be weak in self-mastery.
How can he learn to control himself if he is always
under the will of another? Similar questions
that will help the reader to understand
might be asked. For example: how can a boy
learn to swim if he is not allowed in the water?
How can a girl learn to sew if she is not given
sewing materials? Then is it not just as logical
to ask: how can a child learn to control himself
if he is not given the opportunity to learn? It
is to be feared that too many teachers have had
the wrong idea of discipline; namely, that it
means to have a child constantly under restraint.
That is erroneous. Neither discipline nor authority
requires that. True discipline is that
which directs the child to become a self-governing
individual, so that when he leaves the school,
he can go into the world and lead an efficient life.
Happy is such a child, but unfortunate is the
child who has been so much subjected to another
that when he must face the realities of life he
still needs a guiding hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following incident is very much to the
point. It is the story of two mothers. Each had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>a son who had reached his majority and was
ready to step onto the threshold of the world.
Said the one mother to the other, “I am so fearful
for my boy when he gets into the world. I
have controlled him so carefully, that when he
can not have my oversight, I am sure he will go
into wrong paths.” The other mother replied,
“I am not at all concerned about my boy. I
have kept close to the life of my son, helping
him yet training him for independent action. I
am confident that with his ability to control
himself he need have no fears that the conflicts
of life will overwhelm him. I am assured that
he will succeed.” The latter mother had a true
conception of discipline. The notion of discipline
that the former mother had, is too prevalent
among teachers. It is well worth repeating,
that true discipline is the kind which trains the
child to be self-governing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Remember that any deviation from the routine
of school discipline, any pleasure that may be
granted, any offense that may be forgiven, any
aid in performing a task that may be difficult,
in short any service that shows your devotion to
the child’s welfare may be considered co-operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principle of co-operation when properly
applied will very materially strengthen discipline.
The boy or girl whose every activity is
controlled is being robbed of the greatest gift
that the school can give—self-control. “All
seeming <i>suppression</i> of impulses will be found
to be based upon <i>expression</i> of <i>other</i> impulses,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>not upon sheer brute repression.”<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a> Boys and
girls must be compelled to make decisions for
themselves. But some one will say, “In making
their own decisions they may blunder and decide
in the wrong way.” No permanent harm need
result. Experience is the wisest of teachers.
Children can not be taught in the school of every-day
life until they enter into its experiences; and
fortunate are they, when they enter, if they have
been taught carefully the lessons of self-control
by some prudent parent or teacher. It will make
them stronger if they must help themselves over
their own difficulties. This does not mean that
the teacher must not have taught the principles
of self-control. The real test of good teaching
will come when the boys and girls are compelled
to hold their own in the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who have read Myrtle Reed’s “The
Master’s Violin,” will recall how Mrs. Irving
never allowed her son, Lynn, to solve any of his
own difficulties. Instead of co-operating with
him she dominated him. She was his mind and
bore his trials as well as all his joys and sorrows.
He was often eager to dive into the world with
all its temptations and perplexities, but she could
not permit him to get away from her authority.
She was not an unkind mother, but she was not a
wise mother. When he desired to mingle with
the street lads she would not indulge him lest he
become contaminated. She restrained him from
everything which to her seemed to forecast any
danger. She could not tolerate that he should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>have boyhood fancies and passions. Instead of
guiding him wisely through his boyhood problems,
she laid the hand of restraint upon him.
Her authority was firm though not unkind. The
day finally came when she could no longer solve
or mitigate her son’s problems. Life brought
to him what it may bring to all, dark troubles,
hidden within the soul. He was untutored and
unprepared to meet his trials; his mother could
not meet them for him; she had only greatly
weakened her boy, she had not prepared him by
sensible discipline to meet his troubles. Had she
allowed him to experience some of the problems
that must confront every child, he would have
been prepared to meet his later trials. He could
not escape, so in the bitterest agony he was compelled
to fight his own battles at a grievous loss.</p>

<p class='c008'>A certain fifth grade teacher—in the fifth
grade are often found some of the most troublesome
boys—discovered that by gaining their
friendship she could control and discipline her
room perfectly. Frequently, all the pupils were
allowed to spend an hour or two in some nearby
forest, if in the country, or a park if in the city,
because they had behaved well. Sometimes
school was suspended for a short time and every
pupil was allowed to tell a story. This same
teacher often checked an unruly boy who seemed
on the verge of some impending mischief, by
asking him a question about that which was of
the most interest to him. This might be about
his pets, his gun, the striking novelties in some
recent lesson, or even about some imaginary trip.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>It is not unusual that healthy pupils even
though well reared should be mischievous; this
is due to surplus energy. The teacher, who
could make himself believe that such children
are his enemies, is in the wrong profession. It
is, indeed, a pleasure to work with pupils exuberant
with energy. This energy directed into the
proper channels will insure growth of character
in boys and girls. A certain superintendent in
a small school in Western Ohio found himself in
a high school were the pupils never tired of playing
tricks. They cut down the bell rope, turned
mice loose in school, imitated a cat in another
room and did all kinds of tricks for fun. The
superintendent was new in the school, but it did
not take him long to learn that it was all due to
a surplus of energy in healthful boys and girls.
His solution was to use this energy. To this end
he set about at once securing funds to build a
gymnasium. The Board of Education could not
finance the undertaking, so he enlisted the corps
of teachers and together they secured funds by
private subscription to build the gymnasium.
After the gymnasium was finished, the superintendent
taught the classes in calisthenics and
physical culture. More than once, without discussing
it with the boys and girls, he directed the
entire high school twice a day, for fifteen to
thirty minutes longer than the usual recess period;
the time was used for physical education:
work in folk dances, games and gymnastics.
When the pupils returned to the school-room,
their surplus energy was worked off, their blood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>was filled with oxygen and they were very
studious. He even arranged that those who
were excellent in deportment might attend a
night class, where interesting games were played.
He had boys’ basketball teams, girls’ basketball
teams, volley ball clubs, roller skating clubs,
track work, Saturday afternoon clubs, and other
activities which delighted the pupils. Because
of this mischievous pranks disappeared entirely
and the efficiency of the pupils was increased
nearly fifty per cent. The high school enrolled
seventy pupils on the first day. During the year
only three dropped out, making the per cent of
attendance ninety-five, which is a very good
record.</p>

<p class='c008'>Initiative in co-operation, as it is here discussed,
must not be confused with the common
practice of parents who buy their children’s
good behavior. It is all too common and one of
the worst faults of parents, to tell their children
that they will give them a penny, or some candy
or other articles pleasing to the children if they
will behave while company is in the home.
This may be called a form of compact, but it is
simply a wrong use of co-operation. Many
teachers resort to just such a system of purchasing
good behavior or good lessons. This is
wrong. The proper use of reciprocity has a
worthier motive in it. The teacher who rules
by prudent companionship is kindhearted and
sympathetic, has a broad outlook on child life,
and a spirit that can forgive and forget, and take
back into his love and sympathy the erring pupil.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>There are many ways of giving freedom to a
pupil which will work to his advancement and
advantage. It is true, as it is in all school work,
that caution is necessary, that the true end sought
by the device should not be defeated. Every
teacher knows how kindly a pupil will feel toward
him, if he is allowed to share in some of
the duties to which great honor is attached. This
privilege can be given for good lessons, good behavior,
punctuality or any kind of effort in
school work. Some pupils like to draw, others
to do favors for the teacher, even some will feel
that the teacher appreciates them, if they can
work problems on the black-board, go to the
manual training or domestic science room. It
is indeed a splendid and effective indulgence to
allow any pupil, whether he is the best or the
most indifferent one, to run an errand for the
teacher. To let a boy, who feels that everybody
distrusts him, run down town, or if it is in the
country, to town after dismissals and make a
trivial purchase for the teacher, will make him
gain, first, confidence in himself, and then in his
teacher, because of the fact that his teacher has
confidence in him. Should a pupil abuse the
privileges extended to him as indulgences, then
the teacher, without any explanation can withhold
the privileges for a few days. He will soon
find his pupil asking for, or that which is better,
deserving the privilege. It can be granted, and
it is safe to assume that the pupil will take care
not to forfeit his privileges again.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the primary grades, the little ones like the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>sand-pile, the colored blocks, the privilege of
leading the procession, of drawing on the black-board
with colored crayons, of putting the
teacher’s desk in order, of watering the flowers
in the school-room windows, of running errands,
and a score of similar activities. They will work
hard for hours, or act with great self-restraint,
in order to enjoy one of the above accessories of
the regular school work. They feel that they are
co-operating with the teacher when they work
for her. In the grammar grades pupils often
beg the privilege of holding a spelling-match.
It may often be well to indulge them. They
will appreciate it and have a deeper respect for
the teacher.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is too important a matter of school-room
discipline, and means far too much in the future
of many a boy’s or girl’s life, to overlook the fact
that if pupils are met with authority only they
will challenge that authority. No teacher will
deny that if he allows his pupils many pleasurable
privileges, they will be obedient to his
wishes because he is obedient to their wishes.
One does not have to go far to find a teacher who
has kept many a boy from smoking, chewing
tobacco, gambling or resorting to evil practices,
all because that teacher gave the boy his friendship,
and filled his life with innocent pleasure.
The boy’s own words—and they are often heard—bear
testimony to the fact. Who has not heard
a boy say, “That teacher wanted us to have a
good time, I liked him because he liked the boys,
I minded him because he knew what was good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>for us.” What teacher could not feel proud of
such an encomium? It is a reward far more
lasting than any stipend for the teacher’s work.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not the purpose of this Course to enter into
the discussion of why pupils indulge in many
evil practices, but the teacher should know that
often privileges that lead to no harm are denied
pupils; this causes them to seek to break away
from restraint. As a rule pupils do not admire
or like a teacher who denies them the privileges
they seek. Because of this dislike they are prone
to antagonize the teacher as much as possible,
thus making discipline a more difficult problem
for him. Besides, they will do many things unknown
to the teacher that will lead to evil.
Every one can recall a school where every pupil
seemed bent on getting into mischief, where the
girls were out late at night, the boys frequented
pool-rooms and often saloons, smoked, attended
questionable dances and were vicious generally.
On the other hand, schools can be recalled where
all the pupils seemed well-behaved. In the
former instance the teacher was a cold, formal
individual who did not indulge his pupils in
those many pleasures that amuse and please and
keep them out of mischief. In the latter instance
the teacher was a big-hearted, sympathetic individual,
who loved the boys and girls. He made
room for their youthful sports and even entered
into the games himself. Thus he could lead his
pupils into nobler lives because he acted as one
of their number.</p>

<p class='c008'>A teacher who wishes to render efficient service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>in his work and make himself more successful
in discipline, will use the principle of co-operation.
It would be worth while to spend a
week or two observing all the exercises and activities
of the school and to keep a memorandum
of every phase of the work which could be improved
by working more intimately with the
pupils. <i>The teacher who discretely employs the
principle of co-operation in discipline will improve
his ability to govern fifty per cent.</i> But the
good to the pupils that will result will be gratifying
and lasting. For discipline is a failure if
the results do not appear in the child’s entire life.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Consistency</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>While good results can be obtained by the use
of co-operation, yet it can be made effective only
by practicing consistency. In the application
of the principle of co-operation in discipline, the
teacher needs to be consistent. The entire school
should be treated as a unit. Particular pupils
should not be singled out as recipients of the
teacher’s companionship. Such a procedure
would defeat the effectiveness of the principle.
Many pupils are so amiable that they are more
closely associated with the teacher than more
diffident and bashful pupils. Such pupils will
naturally secure for themselves a goodly share of
the privileges given by the teacher—not because
they are selfish, but because they are more forward.
Thus it will happen that the diffident
pupil will get few or no privileges from the
teacher. This will work great evil in a school.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>Soon some one will accuse the teacher of being
partial when in reality the teacher is not at
fault, since the forward pupil really causes the
teacher to seem partial. Teachers must guard
against this condition, for often parents misunderstand
the situation and likewise accuse the
teacher of being partial. When this happens his
influence is undermined. A careful teacher will
explain to his pupils that the confident pupil
gets more from the teacher than the diffident
and bashful pupil. It is his duty to insist that
the diffident pupil help himself to all privileges.
The teacher needs often to aid bashful pupils to
get privileges; he should in many instances seek
to reassure such pupils. This will lead them to
love and cherish him. No teacher has not had
pupils who invited him into their homes, desired
to walk with him, took him riding, or brought
him various little favors. The sociable teacher
will accept with good grace all these kindnesses
that pupils extend to him. But here it happens
that many pupils will not offer their teachers
such favors. This would be well if other pupils
did not infer that the teacher is partial. He
should make it plain that he loves his pupils all
alike, though some treat him with more consideration
than others.</p>

<p class='c008'>A common fault with teachers who indulge
their pupils is that sometimes they meet with
adversity in the form of an irate parent or some
incompatible person and because of their ruffled
spirits they spend a day in the school-room without
showing even friendship to the pupils. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>next day their feelings are placated and, somehow,
in trying to make up lost time they make
unwise use of indulgence. Such a lack of day by
day consistency will surely destroy the effectiveness
of companionship.</p>

<p class='c008'>A principal of a well-known high school had
accustomed himself to be very friendly and
amiable outside of the school, but when he was
in the school-room his manner was antagonistic.
He seemed unfriendly and not at all courteous
to his pupils. This contrast of mannerism or
temperament had become so marked that many
of the pupils wondered why he did not conduct
himself in the school-room as he did on the
street. Most of his pupils disliked him but admitted
that they could admire him, were he to
conduct himself as amiably in the school-room
as he did outside. This principal failed to practice
a consistency in his life which is so necessary
to make and hold friends.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>The Principle of Substitution</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The law is, “Resist not evil,” for in resisting
it it is only aggravated, “but overcome evil with
good.” When in darkness, fight it not, but strike
a light. When dealing with vice, excite it not,
but awaken a positive virtue. If a child has a
fault, ignore the fact as much as possible, and
develop his better nature. Encourage a virtue
and a vice may disappear.</p>

<p class='c008'>This law is universal in its application. The
teaching profession has yet to learn its significance.
It can be termed the Principle of Substitution.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>It means that when one thing is taken
out of a life, something else must be put in to
fill up the void. When parents and teachers
come fully to appreciate this principle and
magnify virtue, honor and character in the child—ignoring
his evil tendencies—then, and only
then, will it be possible to develop every child
into noble manhood or womanhood.</p>

<p class='c008'>Positive virtues make vice impossible. Aggressive
goodness leaves no room for evil. Pronounced
righteousness once developed in a child,
the problem of his government is settled. It is
prudent to ignore his tendency not to study when
inculcating the habit of study in the pupil. The
habits of idleness, inattentiveness, irregularity
and others detrimental to a pupil’s welfare can
only be eliminated from his life by inciting opposite
habits. Great as may the principles of suggestion,
approval and co-operation, no greater
principle can be discussed than that of substitution.
It is a principle widely useful in many
diverse activities. Just as it is practical in other
fields, so it is feasible and useful in school-room
discipline.</p>

<p class='c008'>The street gamins of New York and other
large cities are addicted to many bad habits.
They lie, steal, swear, gamble and practice many
other vices. They learn these vices by observing
them in others and since there are no other activities
to engage their attention, they live from day
to day in habitual vice until they become criminals.
The settlement workers and such institutions
as the George Junior Republic, work upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>the principle of substitution when they take these
boys into their reformatory institutions. In
them, the boy is not asked to quit his vices; on
the contrary, nothing is said or even suggested
about his former evil habits. Instead, his day
of twenty-four hours is filled with other employment,
so that he has no time left to indulge himself
in any of his former evil habits. This practice
is kept up until the boy has acquired as
habits the activities of the settlement. When he
has reached this stage, he can enter the world.
It is true that some of the most worthy men of
this day are products of boy settlements.</p>

<p class='c008'>A typical day at a boy’s settlement will include
a morning bath and toilet which will send the
boy freshened and cleanly to his breakfast which
is preceded by a short prayer and Bible reading
or some other form of devotional exercise. After
breakfast the boys take up their school work,
or occupation and continue until noon, when
they get their noon-day meal and an hour or two
of rest. Care is taken that the rest is rather a
change of occupation than idleness. The boys
play games or read. In the afternoon some
school work and occupational duties are done.
Part of the afternoon is spent in some recreation
which the boys enjoy. Similarly their time is
occupied until supper. Following supper,
games, reading and any other forms of recreation
that will interest the boys are provided. At
a reasonable hour the boys retire. After such
an active day, they are usually tired and sleep
well until morning when the same routine is followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>for another day. When it is feared the
boys may tire of their work, enough of a change
is made to keep them satisfied. The work is all
conducted in such a way that interest is paramount.
From the above it can readily be seen
that boys in such circumstances have little time
for evil deeds.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is no question but that the same principle
can be used in the school-room to great advantage.
The following are truthful maxims:
“Idleness breeds vice” and “The devil finds some
mischief for idle hands to do.” The school-room
in which everybody is busy is a quiet
school-room. There will not be the proverbial
“pin-drop” quietness, but the little noise that
can be heard will be a noise of busy pupils.
Very often, teachers in planning their daily programs,
fail to have the work so arranged
as to utilize every minute; then in the interval
when the pupils have a lull from their work,
they find time to perpetrate mischief.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another prolific source of mischief is the recess
period. The greater majority of teachers
believe the pupils will take care of themselves
during the recess periods and the noon intermission.
It is true that some of the pupils do use
the time profitably, but too often, it is a lounging
period and the real aim of the intermissions
is not carried out, but rather that which is least
desirable results. It will be a great step in the
direction of advancement when there will be no
longer a free-for-all recess or noon intermission,
but instead supervised play periods in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>every pupil <i>must</i> take part. It is just as reasonable
to compel a pupil to take regular recreation
as it is to demand that he learn his arithmetic or
history lesson. It is more important. He must
have a strong healthy body and it can only be
made and kept so by regular recreation. The
arrangement for getting pupils to the play
ground and from it to the school building again,
should be carefully planned. Opportunities for
mischief should be eliminated. As soon as pupils
are seated, work and study should begin. Habits
of ease and quietness are easily cultivated in
pupils. Whatever of useful employment and
recreation takes up the time of the pupils, leaves
no time for idleness and mischief.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is worth mentioning that many children
are opposed to supervised play. There are parents
too who oppose it. There are several
reasons for this opposition. First, the opposition
is due to the lack of knowledge of child life on
the part of the teacher or those who supervise
the play of children. Children very naturally
follow a leader and if the teacher is a lover of
children and their sports, he will be their leader.
It is not uncommon on the play grounds to
see the boys and girls flock to an adult who is a
real lover of sports. This shows that they really
like older folks in their games. So whenever
such an objection arises it is very necessary that
the teacher or supervisor examine himself for the
cause of the opposition and then speedily remedy
the defect. Another reason is this, however
much we regret it—nevertheless, it is true—there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>are many children especially in grammar
grades and high school who like to use slang or
suggestive language and often indulge in practices
that are little less than immodest. Such
children could not be friendly to a supervisor.
But it is essential that <i>such</i> children should have
a supervisor for their own good. Boys and girls
who conduct themselves in this fashion will not
unaided make virtuous men and women. It is
hard to conceive of parents who would object to
supervised play, but in face of the fact that many
parents are strong agents in the weakening of
their children’s characters, it becomes the more
necessary for the teacher to be fearless and supervise
the play. A good teacher must many times
do that which parents will not approve, but it is
his duty to act always according to his best judgment.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following story was told by an old man.
He said that when he was young he was quite
wicked; among the evils in which he indulged
was evil thinking and vulgar and blasphemous
language. He had become so offensive that
many people shunned him. He was aware of his
condition but was unable to change himself.
One day a friend advised him to memorize a
number of good poems and sacred songs. Whenever
his mind should revert to evil thoughts or
he had a desire to use vile language, he was to
repeat the poems, or if he was where he could
sing, he was to sing some of the sacred songs.
He did as he was advised. Persistently he followed
his friend’s counsel, and in less than six
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>month’s time, he had cured himself of his evil-mindedness
and the use of vile and blasphemous
language.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same principle of substitution that the old
man used when he was a youth is very applicable
to many problems that arise in the school-room.
Of course, it must be borne in mind that the
teacher does not have the child for the entire
day, and that the home may offset much that the
teacher does. If such is the case, the teacher’s
only chance of success is to solicit the aid of the
home. While he may not be able to do this in
every instance, it is fair to assume he will get
the home aid necessary in almost every case.
All voluntary acts of the child are founded upon
some motive. The teacher’s attack against any
bad habit of a pupil must not be a direct attack
against the habit itself. Another type of action
should be substituted for it. It is a very homely
illustration but nevertheless true, that a cesspool
can not be removed by removing the refuse. It
will fill up again. But if the pool is filled with
good solid earth, the pool will not return again.
So it is with an evil in any child’s or adult’s life.
If the evil is removed, put a positive good habit
or activity in its place or the evil habit will return.
It is often the case that the evil habit
crowds out the good habit after it has been admitted
into the child’s life. This cannot happen
under the watchful care of a good teacher.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principle of substitution may be likened
to the planting of a lily garden where once
flourished a bed of thistles. The teacher must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>ever be on the look out for a place where he can
plant a positive virtue. When planted it must
be nurtured and cared for until it reaches perfection.
It will then crowd out at least one vice.
Discouragement should not thwart the teacher
in his attempts to eliminate evil from a child’s
life. His duty is clear and he should summon
every aid to his assistance in order to accomplish
his purpose.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>The Principle of Expectancy</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>“Seek and ye shall find,” “Knock and it shall
be opened,” are Biblical injunctions that embody
more truth than appears on the surface. Just as
true is it to say, “Expect and ye shall receive
what ye expect.” The following true incident
is very much to the point and worth repeating.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the first few years of the nineteenth
century a French lad was learning to be a drummer
for the French Army. Among the various
selections of army music which he was required
to learn was a retreat. When it came time to
learning the army retreat, he refused, telling his
teacher that he never expected to beat a retreat.
“But,” said the teacher, “no army can be so victorious
but that sometime in its career it must
retreat.” Again the boy replied, “I never expect
to beat a retreat.” It was but a year later when
he became a drummer boy in Napoleon’s army.
In one of the hardest fought battles of Napoleon’s
military career, it became apparent to
Napoleon that his army would be defeated and
practically all captured. To save this situation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>the great general ordered a retreat. The drummer
boy did not beat a retreat. Napoleon angered,
rode up to the boy and in harsh tones
ordered the lad to beat a retreat. The lad looked
up and replied, “I can not beat a retreat.” The
now enraged general shouted, “Beat a retreat!”
Again came the firm, resolute reply, “I can not
beat a retreat.” There was in the lad’s expression
a look of firm expectation that he would
not need to beat a retreat. The general was
furious, he whirled his horse about and derisively
shouted back, “Then beat a charge.” At
once that firm determination which made the
boy self-confident and expectant, fired his spirit
and he began to beat a charge. All the years of
resolution and expectancy that were pent up in
his soul now echoed and re-echoed in those drum
beats. The soldiers caught the spirit of firmness
and, thrilled with an ardor that they had never
felt before, they followed the drummer boy to
victory.</p>

<p class='c008'>The above story illustrates the Principle of
Expectancy—a principle that is fundamental in
discipline. It goes much further than merely to
expect a thing to be done when it is commanded.
It becomes a part of the individual, if that individual
has a firm grip upon the principle of
expectancy. It is a principle that will inspire
the teacher with self-confidence. Everyone can
recall some teachers who had so firm a belief in
their ability to do things and secure results as to
have no fear that assigned tasks would not be
well done. When the teacher has the principle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>of expectancy so well fused into himself as to
have confidence that he will get whatever he
justly seeks, then, and only then, will he be an
accomplished disciplinarian.</p>

<p class='c008'>The writer once visited the gymnasium of a
public school just when the high school pupils
were taking their regular daily exercises. The
exercises were being directed by the principal.
At the close of the gymnastic period, the principal
in a whining tone of voice with these words
commanded the pupils to leave the gymnasium:
“I want you to leave the gymnasium now—right
away now.” This teacher did not expect the
pupils to leave the gymnasium promptly. He
implied that much in his command. He got
what he expected. Many of the pupils continued
to loiter about the gymnasium striking at
each other and making other useless movements.
It took several more whining commands before
he succeeded in getting the gymnasium cleared
of pupils. In fact, some left it so reluctantly as
to show that they had been antagonized by the
principal. This all came about by an improper
attitude of the principal in his lack of expecting
his command to be obeyed. Had he said to the
pupils in a firm tone of voice at the close of the
gymnastic period, “This is all,” and then stepped
to the door and opening it, standing aside and
expecting nothing else, except that every pupil
would promptly leave the building, the result
would have been different. Every pupil would
have left the gymnasium promptly and the spirit
of antagonism would not have appeared.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>In actual school work, no principle can do
more good in its application than the principle
of expectancy. One teacher can assign a lesson
to a class without any admonishing or even the
slightest suggestion that they should study the
lesson. The class will return on the following
day and recite a good lesson. Another teacher
may assign to this same class a lesson, also without
a suggestion as to the class preparing the
lesson. However, in the next recitation the class
will not have the lesson. Upon careful investigation
it will be found that the one teacher has
in his make-up that something which makes
pupils feel and know that he expects nothing else
than that his pupils will learn the lessons he assigns
them. He does not inform his pupils in
so many words that he expects them to study
the lesson he assigns. He assumes as much;
then, with a confidence in his pupils that is compelling
he expects them to do his every bidding.
The other teacher, not in words either, but in
his very manner, is vacillating. He lacks confidence
in himself and in his pupils. He is suspicious.
He is not sure his pupils will study if
he tells them to. He can not assign a lesson with
a safe feeling that the pupils can do nothing else
but learn it. He waits until the class comes before
him, and then begins the recitation in a
half-hearted way as though he knew they did not
know the lesson. It is a safe assumption. He is
not disappointed. The class has not prepared
the lesson. There are many teachers who think
themselves “smart” and wise, when they can say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>to a class before they have even begun the recitation,
“You look as though you did not have your
lesson. I can tell it by your eyes.” Such a
teacher is a liar. No teacher can tell beforehand
whether a class has a lesson or not. It is little
wonder that so many teachers fail. They are the
rocks of destruction to their own pupils.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the other hand, in the actual discipline of
the pupils, the principle of expectancy is of vital
importance. Who can not recall a teacher going
to the back of the school-room to correct a pupil
and then walking away casting side-wise glances,
and sometimes making quick turns about, as
much as to tell the pupil, “I am suspicious of
you.” But the information is far broader than
that. That teacher by his suspicious attitude
tells his pupil that he is expecting the pupil to
perpetrate more mischief. If he did not think
the pupil would repeat his pranks, he would not
need to watch him. Thoughtful teachers can afford
to reflect upon this. Nothing is more liable
to breed mischief and contempt among pupils
than to treat them as though they can never be
trusted. A teacher practicing such an attitude
of suspicion can never succeed in school-room
discipline. To reprimand a pupil and then have
enough confidence to expect the pupil not to repeat
the offense will without fail reach the better
self of the pupil. He will not repeat the offense.
Teachers should always expect the best result to
follow their efforts. They should make expectancy
the keynote of their lives. Not to be expectant
is to be suspicious. The question can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>very appropriately be asked: “What pupil likes
to be suspected always by his teacher?” And
with emphasis: “What teacher would like to be
suspected?” Then it is high time that teachers
expect more from their pupils. They will get
more. Expect them to know their lessons, and
they will prepare them. Expect them to be
obedient, and they will be obedient. Expect
them to be kind and courteous, and they will be
kind and courteous. To live in expectancy is
to live in hope. To the teacher who expects the
good and hopes for the better, there can never be
a dull and dreary school. The principle of expectancy
is the teacher’s beacon light; he should
never take his eye from it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again, the principle of expectancy is correlated
with the other fundamental principles
of discipline. A teacher who by word, a look,
a story or a deed, suggests something, would indeed
be foolish if he did not expect his suggestion
to ripen into action. A teacher should approve
the well learned lessons of a pupil, his
punctuality, his efforts, not only that the child
may have a reward in the form of the teacher’s
approval, but also that he may learn that any
activity worth while will meet with due appreciation.
Such recognition by the teacher
stimulates the pupil to continue in his good efforts
long after being lauded. Teachers confer
benefits upon pupils, thus rewarding them
for their activities, expecting the pupils to continue
in well-doing after having withdrawn
from them these special privileges. The same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>can be said of the principle of substitution. It is
very closely correlated with the principle of expectancy.
It is apparent that a teacher would
not attempt to substitute in a child’s life some
good habit, if he did not expect it to crowd out an
evil habit. A broad statement, but not too broad
or general can be made about the principle of
expectancy. It is this: just to the degree that
the teacher practices and is permeated with the
principle of expectancy, just so successful will
he be in the use of other fundamental principles
of discipline.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Firmness</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Something has been said about firmness. It
is implied in the principle of expectancy. The
teacher who failed to get his class out of the
gymnasium promptly, lacked firmness. He was
weak and vacillating. A weak and vacillating
character is in no sense a moral force in any
community, and much less in the school-room.
Pupils are quick to detect the lack of firmness in
a teacher and are ever ready to make a play-thing
of him. A safe rule in the school-room,
and all its activities, is to decide a right course of
action and then firmly follow it. Firmness with
a proper determination and force on the part of
the teacher adds charm to his manner and personality,
that easily elicits from pupils and parents
both respect and obedience.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the preceding discussion emphasis has been
placed upon five great fundamental principles
in discipline. The principles discussed are: (1)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>The principle of Suggestion, (2) The principle
of Approval, (3) The principle of Initiative in
Co-operation, (4) The principle of Substitution,
and (5) The principle of Expectancy. It has
been clearly explained how they are applied to
the school-room work. Very concrete and real
illustrations have been given to show just exactly
the province of each principle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Reference has been made to these fundamental
principles as devices. They are devices,
or they may be designated as means to an end.
It has been pointed out that the end of discipline,
that is, the goal sought, is self-control. The
fundamental principles when properly applied
are roads, devices or means—that lead to results,
which results reach the one goal, self-control.
It is entirely unnecessary to indulge in a lengthy
discussion of results but, suffice it to say, the
teacher by this time is aware of many good
results that will accrue from the discreet use of
the fundamental principles in discipline. There
will result the six basal elements in character—namely,
the establishment of sound sentiments,
a quickening of the conscience, an enlightening
or moral judgment, a training of the will to act
habitually from high and worthy motives, a
thoughtfulness of the rights of others, and last
but not least a practical religious training.
“Character is the total customary reaction of an
individual to his environment.”<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a> The child
who leaves the school well trained in these six
basal elements of character, has received at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>hands of the school as much, and even more, as
some may suppose, than that institution owes to
childhood.</p>

<div class='sect'>

<h3 class='c010'>Summary</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>1. The idea, that fundamental principles in
discipline are not broadly applicable in the
school-room, is false and unpedagogical.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Fundamental principles operate toward
definite ends.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. The failure to use fundamental principles
in discipline gives rise to difficulties in school-management.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. Like begets like. The same spirit that the
teacher manifests in the school-room is the spirit
that will take root and grow in the lives of his
pupils.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. The principle of suggestion drops a stimulus
into the child’s mind which starts an action.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. Suggestion for character building comes
from the character of the teacher—his every-day
life.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. All of the activities of the teacher are suggestive
of good or bad to the pupil.</p>

<p class='c008'>8. Negative suggestions often incite the very
actions they are supposed to prevent.</p>

<p class='c008'>9. Codes of rules against numerous offenses,
usually suggest those offenses to pupils. They
are reminded to do that which they would never
have thought of, had it not been suggested.</p>

<p class='c008'>10. Many of the activities of life depend upon
the law of suggestion.</p>

<p class='c008'>11. Suggestion is a potent agency in volition.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>12. Leading suggestion is a name applied to a
principle which says, “Suggest only a small part
of a duty at a time, then a little more and so on
until all the duty has been done.” Very often,
to suggest a long series of acts to the child does
not appeal to him effectively.</p>

<p class='c008'>13. Imitation is closely related to suggestion.
Pupils especially imitate and make use of suggestions
from those whom they like.</p>

<p class='c008'>14. The principle of approval in discipline is
valuable in that it appeals to the child by showing
one’s satisfaction and pleasure in the good
work he has done.</p>

<p class='c008'>15. The opposite of approval is fault finding.
It is not too radical to say that a teacher should
never be guilty of fault finding.</p>

<p class='c008'>16. Many faults in children can be eradicated
by a judicious use of the principle of approval.</p>

<p class='c008'>17. It is an easy matter to discourage and ruin
the best pupils by constant fault finding.</p>

<p class='c008'>18. By approving what little of good there is
in a bad child, the child may be improved, and
helped to become a good child.</p>

<p class='c008'>19. The teacher who does not embody in his
life worthy traits of character, can not effectively
approve them in other lives. The source of approval
is important.</p>

<p class='c008'>20. Encouragement is a form of approval.</p>

<p class='c008'>21. Sometimes the best pupils have met grievous
obstacles and need positive encouragement.</p>

<p class='c008'>22. The fundamental principle of Initiative
in Co-operation may be applied to advantage in
discipline in several ways. A word, a look, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>deed, a material object, a privilege—all may be
instruments of initiative in co-operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>23. Doing a favor must not be confused with
the practice of buying good behavior or work,
because the effect is entirely different.</p>

<p class='c008'>24. Pupils cannot be taught to govern themselves
if they are always governed by some
stronger will. Children must be allowed to
form judgments of their own so that later they
can make their own good decisions.</p>

<p class='c008'>25. Often even prudent concessions are denied
to pupils; the result is that they gratify themselves
and as a rule fall into hurtful excesses.</p>

<p class='c008'>26. Consistency on the part of the teacher is
necessary if initiative in co-operation is to be
prudently applied.</p>

<p class='c008'>27. A teacher cannot be consistent when he is
liberal in kindnesses one day and on another day
makes no concessions at all.</p>

<p class='c008'>28. Care must be exercised in using the principle
of initiative in co-operation, so that all pupils
are benefited as nearly alike as their merits
will allow. Unless teachers are careful, they
will be accused of being partial.</p>

<p class='c008'>29. The principle of substitution assumes that
a positive virtue must be cultivated in a child,
when we desire to remove a vice.</p>

<p class='c008'>30. The institutions for reforming bad boys
from the large cities are conducted on the principle
of substitution. The boy’s life is filled with
useful work and recreation which replaces his
idle habits.</p>

<p class='c008'>31. In the school-room it is highly essential
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>that the day be filled with useful work and play;
if there is idle time, pupils will use it in mischief-making.</p>

<p class='c008'>32. Free-for-all recesses and noon intermissions
are breeding spots in the school day for
mischief and evil.</p>

<p class='c008'>33. Supervised play is the only solution for
the wise use of the play period and the crowding
out of occasion for evil at school.</p>

<p class='c008'>34. The teacher should pay no attention to the
objections to supervised play. The objections
come from those who misunderstand or those
who have low motives.</p>

<p class='c008'>35. The principle of expectancy is closely correlated
with the other great principles underlying
discipline.</p>

<p class='c008'>36. Just to the extent that the teacher is able
to use the fundamental principle of expectancy,
and only so far will he be successful in the use of
the other fundamental principles of discipline.</p>

<p class='c008'>37. It is necessary to use firmness and determination
with the principle of expectancy.</p>

<p class='c008'>38. The fundamental principles of discipline
are the teacher’s devices, or means, which he
must use to obtain the end of discipline—self-control.</p>
